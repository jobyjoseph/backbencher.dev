In a typical React application, there will be lot of components one nested inside another. The depth of nesting can be really big in some cases. What if we need to pass a value from parent component to a child component that is nested few levels deep?

One solution is to **pass the value as props** from one level to next level. This is more kind of water flowing through steps. Even though this solution works, it can be a nightmare for the developer sometimes.

Context API can help us here. We can set the value to be passed to the context using `Provider`. Here is an example where I pass the value as `"dog"`.

```javascript
<ThemeContext.Provider value="dog">
  // ... Nested components
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

And then inside the nested component where we need to get the value, retrieve it using `this.context`.

Above example assumed we are using class components. In function components we can make use of `useContext()` hook.
