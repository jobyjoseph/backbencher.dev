In order to setup Next.js in a computer, we need MacOS, Windows or Linux installed in the machine. Also, we need Node.js to be installed.

If Node.js is installed, we can setup Next.js using below command.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

`npx` is a NPM package executor. We can both download and run a package using `npx` command. `npx` is automatically available if your NPM version in your machine is v5.2.0 or higher.

Another package manager is <Olink link="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</Olink>. Using the `yarn` global command also, we can setup Next.js using:

```
yarn create next-app
```

If you are using <Olink link="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</Olink>, you can setup Next.js using:

```
pnpm create next-app
```

The setup process is interactive. Follow the instructions and you will get a project that has Next.js setup in it.
