A number whose base is `16` is called a hexadecimal number. By base 16, it means we have only 16 digits to form all the numbers. They are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` and `F`.

If we follow hexadecimal number system in daily life, this is how we count 20 apples:
