Here is a code that inserts an item to specific index. Here, there is no pushing or popping, instead just replace at an index.

```javascript
const arr = [2, 5, 7, 9];
arr[2] = 8; // ğŸ‘‰ O(1)
console.log(arr[2]); // 8
```

The position can be easily calculated by the **index number** and **each item size**.

Irrespective of the index position, time taken to insert a value is a constant.

> Big-O of inserting an item to array is O(1)
