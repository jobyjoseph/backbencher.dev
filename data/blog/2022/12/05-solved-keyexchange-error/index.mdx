I was trying to fetch latest contents from Gitlab repository. All of a sudden I got this error:

```
kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
Connection closed by 172.65.251.92 port 22
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

Fun fact is that, I have been working, pushing and pulling code with this same repository for the past 2 years. From where this error came all of a sudden?

What happened was that my laptop automatically got connected to my companies guest Wifi account. That account is not authorized to access Gitlab repository.

So if you get this error, check your network or check if proper VPN connection is established.
