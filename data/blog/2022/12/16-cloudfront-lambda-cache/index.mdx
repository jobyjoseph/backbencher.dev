When Cloudfront serves content from Lambda@edge, the response from Lambda@edge is cached. So, when Cloudfront receives a request again, it serves from cache.

In some cases, you might want to disable caching for Lambda@edge. You want all requests to invoke the Lambda@edge function. For that, you need to customize the Cloudfront **Behavior** that is attched to Lambda@edge function.

In the image above the Lamba@edge functions are associated with **Origin request** and **Origin response**. That will cache the output. Instead, attach the same function to **Viewer request** and **Viewer response**. That will make sure that for all viewer requests, the Lambda@edge function is invoked.
