ArrayBuffer in JavaScript is a **pure byte array**, where each elements are stored in **contigous** memory locations. The old array, `new Array()` behaves like an array, but in the core it does not store elements in contigous memory.

```javascript
const a = new ArrayBuffer(6);
console.log(a);
```

For the code above the output will be:

```javascript
ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <00 00 00 00 00 00>, byteLength: 6 }
```

The `00 00 00 00 00 00` are the 6 contigous memory locations. Each memory location is treated as an `Uint8` data.
