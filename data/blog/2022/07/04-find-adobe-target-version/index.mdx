Adobe Target works by loading an Adobe script to client side browser. This script file name is `at.js`. Last day, I had to fix an Adobe Target issue in a production site. I was new to Adobe Target and after reading through the documentation, I came to know that there are two major `at.js` version. It can be either `v1.x` or `v2.x`.

I needed to know which version the site is using. I finally found it and here I am explaining what I did.

When Adobe loads its script, it creates a global `adobe` object in the browser.

<Image src={imgAdobeObject} alt="Adobe Object" style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }} />

The `adobe` object contains different services that Adobe provides like `target`. Next, print the value of `adobe.target.VERSION`. It prints the version of `at.js` loaded.

<Image
  src={imgTargetVersion}
  alt="Adobe Target Version"
  style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}
/>
