I was trying to install the dependencies of an existing project using:

```
yarn install
```

All of a sudden I saw this error in terminal:

```
...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
error Incorrect integrity when fetching from the cache
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.
```

The solution to this problem is to do a cache cleaning. Just run following command from the same position:

```
yarn cache clean
```

After running above command, we can proceed with `yarn install` or `yarn add` commands. It should work fine.
