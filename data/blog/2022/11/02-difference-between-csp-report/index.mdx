`Content-Security-Policy` is comparitively a new header supported by modern browsers.

What does it do?

Say, a web page is having below `Content-Security-Policy` header in the response:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://example.com/
```

And the loaded HTML contains below `<script />` tag:

```html
<script src="https://not-example.com/js/library.js"></script>
```

Then, `library.js` is not loaded and executed. `script-src` says that the page can load and execute JavaScript files **only from** `https://example.com`.

So, what is `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`?

If in the above case, the response header contains `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` instead of `Content-Security-Policy`, `library.js` is loaded and executed. But, in the browser console we can see the policy error.

So in essence, `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` executes the script, but warns you about the problematic scripts. `Content-Security-Policy` simply blocks the problematic scripts or files.
