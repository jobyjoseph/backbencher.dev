`useRef()` hook helps us to access DOM nodes directly. In React, data-flow is unidirectional. If a child component in React, needs to update something in parent component, the parent needs to pass a reference to child. Child then uses the reference for updating the parent.

## Accessing Parent DOM Node

Here we have two components, `Parent` and `Child`. The `Parent` component contains a `h1` block.

```javascript
export default function Parent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Title</h1>
      <Child />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `Child` component just contains a `button`.

```javascript
function Child() {
  return <button>Click Me</button>;
}
```

Our goal is to change the heading color to red, when we click on the button. For that, our `Parent` component needs to pass _header connection_ to the `Child`. We are going to create that connection using `useRef()`.

In order to use `useRef()`, first we need to import it from `react` package.

```javascript
import { useRef } from "react";
```

Next we need to create a ref object.

```javascript
const headerRef = useRef(null);
```

But right now, the created `headerRef` object is not connected to any DOM nodes. We are going to connect it to our `h1` tag using `ref` attribute.

```javascript
<h1 ref={headerRef}>Parent Title</h1>
```

So now, `headerRef` is our key to do anything on our header. Lets pass this key to our child component.

```javascript
<Child headerRef={headerRef} />
```

In the child component, we take the value of our ref object. The current value of a ref object can be taken from `.current` property of ref.

Here is the complete code of child component that changes the header color to red on button click.

```javascript
function Child(props) {
  function clickHandler() {
    props.headerRef.current.style.color = "red";
  }

  return <button onClick={clickHandler}>Click Me</button>;
}
```
