import Olink from "../../../../src/components/olink";

`useEffect()` hook brings different life-cycle methods to a **functional component**. This hook performs side-effects in functional component. If you did not get any idea, do not worry. You can understand in detail by reading below sections.

## Import useEffect

`useEffect()` hook comes as part of `react` package from React **v16.8**. In order to use `useEffect()` in our code, first step is to import it from React package.

```javascript
import { useEffect } from "react";
```

## useEffect() Arguments

`useEffect()` hook accepts two arguments, a **callback function** and an **array**.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Callback function");
}, []);
```

The callback function passed to `useEffect()` is invoked as a side-effect on change of any state variables.

What all state variables we need to track, that information is passed to the second array argument.

## No Dependency Array

We learned that `useEffect()` accepts two arguments. In that, second argument is called the **dependency array**. What if we are not passing the second argument?

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Oh! Side-effect is triggered.");
});
```

Here, since `useEffect()` does not have any dependency array to check against, it will invoke the callback function on component load and on every state change.

Here is a code which you can try:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function () {
  const [random, setRandom] = useState();

  //highlight-start
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Oh! Side-effect is triggered.");
  });
  //highlight-end
  const buttonClickHander = () => {
    setRandom(Math.random());
  };

  return <button onClick={buttonClickHander}>Click Me!</button>;
}
```

Above code updates the value of `random` state variable on each button click. The `"Oh! Side-effect is triggered."` message is printed in the console on the component load and on every button click. You can try above code online at <Olink link="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hooks-idcwej?file=/src/useEffect/noDependencyArray.js">CodeSandbox</Olink>.

## Empty Dependency Array

Here, we are passing the second dependency array argument as an empty array(`[]`). That is the way of telling React that, there are no state variables to watch for. Therefore, in this case, the `useEffect()` callback function will run only once when the component loads.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Loaded on component load");
}, []);
```

Above code is equivalent to `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method in **class components**.

You can play with `useEffect()` hook with empty dependency array in <Olink link="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hooks-idcwej?file=/src/useEffect/emptyDependencyArray.js">CodeSandbox</Olink>.

## Selective Dependency Array

Say, we have two state variables in our component. And, we want `useEffect()` hook to invoke the callback function, only when **one of the state variable changes**. In this case, we need to pass only that state variable name to the dependency array.

```javascript
const [color, setColor] = useState();
const [age, setAge] = useState();

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Color changed!");
}, [color]);
```

Here is the full component code which changes the `color` and `age` values through a button click.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function () {
  const [color, setColor] = useState();
  const [age, setAge] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Color changed!");
  }, [color]);

  const colorClickHander = () => {
    setColor(Math.random());
  };

  const ageClickHander = () => {
    setAge(Math.random());
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={colorClickHander}>Change Color</button>
      <button onClick={ageClickHander}>Change Age</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Since we are tracking only the `color` variable, changing the value of `age` does not have any side effect.

When the above component loads, it prints the `"Color changed!"` message once. Later, we can see the message logged again only when the value of `color` changes.

## Async Callback Function

What if we need to use `await` inside `useEffect()` callback function? Here is how the code we wish to write:

```javascript
useEffect(async () => {
  console.log("hi");
  // do something with await
}, []);
```

> Before trying `async` in your code, ensure that `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` is installed and configured in `.babelrc` file.

Using `async` directly in the callback function is NOT allowed by React. It throws a very detailed error along with a solution approach.

```
Warning: useEffect must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up.

It looks like you wrote useEffect(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately
```

As suggested in the error message, we can go for an IIFE inside the effect to achieve our goal:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // highlight-start
  (async () => {
    console.log("hi");
  })();
  // highlight-end
}, []);
```

## Callback Returning a Function

In class components, there is a lifecycle method called `ComponentDidUnmount()`. The method is fired when a component is **removed** from the DOM. Usually, some logic like clearing a timer is executed inside this lifecycle method. Now the question is, how can we bring that lifecycle method to a functional component?

As we just learned, `useEffect()` accepts a callback function and a dependency array. Usually the callback function returns `undefined`. Instead, we are going to **return a function** now:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log("The returned function");
  };
}, []);
```

This returned function is invoked when the component is removed from the DOM.

In order to test this, we need to write a logic in the parent Component to hide this component based on some condition.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {showComponent && <MyComponent />}
      <br />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setShowComponent(false);
        }}
      >
        Hide
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As we can see, in the parent component, we are hiding our component when the button is clicked. So, when user clicks on the button, we can see `"The returned function"` in the browser console.

Some of the cases that might need componentDidUnmount are clearing timers, unsubscribe RxJS events or websocket events, detach event handlers.
