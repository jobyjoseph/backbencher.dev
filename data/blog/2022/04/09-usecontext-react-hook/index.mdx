Context makes it easy to **pass data** from a component to any of its child components. The child component can be of **any level**.

## Passing Data Without Props

Here we have four components. It is named as `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, `L4` to show the level of component in which it is used.

```javascript
export default function L1() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 1</h4>
      <L2 />
    </div>
  );
}

function L2() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 2</h4>
      <L3 />
    </div>
  );
}

function L3() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 3</h4>
      <L4 />
    </div>
  );
}

function L4() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 4</h4>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We need to now pass some data from `L1` to `L4`. How to do it? The only way is like water flowing down in steps. The data needs to be passed from `L1` to `L2` through props, then from `L2` to `L3` and finally, `L3` to `L4`. Here is how it looks like:

```javascript
export default function L1() {
  const name = "Joby";

  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 1</h4>
      <L2 name={name} />
    </div>
  );
}

function L2(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 2</h4>
      <L3 name={props.name} />
    </div>
  );
}

function L3(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 3</h4>
      <L4 name={props.name} />
    </div>
  );
}

function L4(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 4</h4>
      <h3>Name is {props.name}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Above code produces below output:

<Image
  src={imgPassDataProps}
  alt="Pass data through props"
  style={{ maxWidth: "150px" }}
/>

## Passing Data Using Context

Context acts like a global space. Once we create and connect a context to a component, the component and all its children have access to the context to fetch the data. It will be more clear with an example.

### Create Context

First step is to create a context object. For that, import `createContext` from React.

```javascript
import { createContext } from "react";
```

Next, we create a context object.

```javascript
const NameContext = createContext("John");
```

Here, `"John"` is the default value of the context. We can override the value when using the context object.

### Provide Context

We need to now provide the context to the `L1` component. For that, wrap the `L1` component inside `NameContext.provider`. Also, we can pass a `value` attribute. This value is then available to all child components.

```javascript
export default function L1() {
  const name = "Joby";

  return (
    <NameContext.Provider value={name}>
      <div>
        <h4>Level 1</h4>
        <L2 name={name} />
      </div>
    </NameContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

As we can see above, we are passing a string `"Joby"` as value. This new value override the default `"John"` value.

### Read Context Value

In the earlier section, we provided the value in `L1` component. Next, we are trying to take the value in `L4` component. For that, we can use `useContext()` hook.

```javascript
function L4() {
  const name = useContext(NameContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Level 4</h4>
      <h3>Name is {name}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`useContext()` accepts a context object and returns the value it stores. This is how `useContext()` shares data across components.

## useContext() Usage

If in our application, we need some data to be available globally, it is good to use **Context**. One application can be site theme. Based on Light or Dark theme, all the components needs to update their styles.

### Context vs Redux

Latest Redux internally uses Context API. It is suggested to use either Redux or Context. Using both at the same time is not suggested.
