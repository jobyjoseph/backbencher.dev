Like sentences in English language, a complete meaningful line in JavaScript is called a statement. Just like periods separate sentences, semicolons(`;`) separate statements in JavaScript.

```java
const a = 10; console.log(a);
```

We normally write one statement per line as shown below:

```javascript
const a = 10;
console.log(a);
```

## Optional Semicolons

When we write one statement per line, we can omit the semicolon if we want.

```java
const a = 10
console.log(a)
```

JavaScript will automatically figure out the statments based on the rules of the language.

## Figuring out Statements

Consider the below code:

```javascript
let age = 20;
console.log(age);
```

Will the above code work? Yes. JavaScript usually treats line breaks as semicolons only if it can't parse the code without adding an implicit semicolon.

In the above code, JavaScript starts grouping from first line as if each line is a piece of lego.

```
let
let age
let age =
let age = 20
let age = 20 console
```

So here is how the parser thinks:

It takes the first word `let` and asks, "Can `let` and `age` come together?". The answer is "yes". Like wise, it keeps on adding the blocks.

"Can `let`, `age` and `=` come together?" Yes!

"Can `let`, `age`, `=` and `20` come together?" Yes!

"Can `let`, `age`, `=`, `20` and `console` come together?" No!. If it is a `No`, JavaScript automatically inserts a semicolon between `20` and `console`.

This is how JavaScript figure out different statements.

Here is a tricky code snippet:

```java
let b = 10
let a = b
(a).toString()
```

What is the output for above code?

You might expect the value `'10'` as output. But, you might face the error `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization`. It is because, JavaScript treated above code as:

```javascript
let b = 10;
let a = b(a).toString();
```

As a best practice, it is always good to put semicolons in the code.

There are three exceptions to this semicolon insertion rule.

### First Exception

What is the output of below code?

```java
function fun() {
  return
  6
}
console.log(fun())
```

We expect the output to be `6` because `return 6` forms a valid statement. But JavaScript returns from the function as soon as it sees the `return` keyword. Therefore the output will be `undefined`.

This special type of working is not only for `return`. `throw`, `yield`, `break` and `continue` also work like this. If there is continuation for these keywords, ensure that there is no line break in between.

### Second Exception

What is the output of below code?

```java
let a = 10
console.log(a)
+
+
a
console.log(a)
```

Your guess might be `10` and `11`. Instead, above code prints `10` and `10`. Unary increment(`++`) and decrement(`--`) operators do not work as expected without semicolons. Always the unary operator(`++`) and the operand(`a`) should be in the same line.

### Third Exception

Arrow functions which were introduced in ES6, needs to be in the same line.

```java
let
a
=
()
=>
10
console.log(a())
```

Above code throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '=>'` error. Instead if we edit the above code, just to keep the arrow function in the same line, things will start working. Here is the updated code:

```java
let
a
=
() => 10
console.log(a())
```

Above code prints `10` in the console.
