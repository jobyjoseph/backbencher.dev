Literal is a **data value** that is used directly in a JavaScript code.

Here are some examples:

```
34
"Backbencher.dev"
null
```

Based on the type of data value, the literals can be classified as:

1. Number literal
2. String literal
3. Boolean literal
4. null literal
5. undefined literal
6. Array literal
7. Object literal

## Number Literal

Literals that are of type **number** are called number literals.

Here are some examples:

```
23
45.12
-12
```

## String Literal

Literals that are of type **string** are called string literals.

Here are some examples:

```
""
"Backbencher"
```

## Boolean literal

There are only **two** boolean literals. They are `true` and `false`.

## null and undefined literals

`null` is a literal that is of `null` type.

`undefined` is a literal that is of `undefined` type.
