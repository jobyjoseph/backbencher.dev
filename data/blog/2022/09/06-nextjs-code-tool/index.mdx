When creating a page in Next.js, there are code that runs only in server. There are also code that is added to the bundle and returned to the browser.

If you are a beginner in Next.js, it might be difficult to separate one from another. Next.js has come up with a <Olink link="https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/">code elimination tool</Olink> to give more clarity on this.

Let us checkout this application. For that, here is a Next.js _Contact Us_ page code:

```javascript
const clientSideFunction = () => {
  return "Apple";
};

const serverSideFunction = () => {
  return "Banana";
};

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      fruit: serverSideFunction(),
    },
  };
}

const ContactUs = () => {
  return <h1>Contact us page {clientSideFunction()}</h1>;
};

export default ContactUs;
```

Here there are two util functions `clientSideFunction()` and `serverSideFunction()`. `clientSideFunction()` is called in the page component and `serverSideFunction()` is called only in `getServerSideProps()`.

When Next.js renders the page, only below code is passed to client.

```javascript
// This is the code that is bundled for the client-side:

const clientSideFunction = () => {
  return "Apple";
};
const ContactUs = () => {
  return <h1>Contact us page {clientSideFunction()}</h1>;
};
export var __N_SSP = true;
export default ContactUs;
```

Main thing to note is that, along with `getServerSideProps()`, `serverSideFunction()` is also removed by Next.js. Next.js is intelligently tree-shaking the dependencies and removing unused code.
