An identifier is simple a **name**. In real world, we need names for people, things or countries to differentiate one from another. Similarly, we need names for following entities in JavaScript:

- Constants
- Variables
- Properties
- Functions
- Classes
- Labels

## Rules for Identifier

In order to be a valid identifier, the identifier should meet following rules:

1. The first letter of the identifier should be either an alphabet(A-Z, a-z), underscore(\_) or dollar($).
2. Subsequent characters can be alphabets, numbers, underscore and dollar.

Here are few examples of valid identifiers:

```
i
_
$
name
_age
$jQuery
a1234
```

Following identifiers are not valid:

```
2ndNumber
%value
Awesome!
```
