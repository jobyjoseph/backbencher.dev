`const` keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript.

```javascript
const a = 10;
```

We can declare multiple constants at the same time.

```javascript
const a = 10,
  b = 20;
```

We can export constants using `export` keyword.

```javascript
export const a = 10,
  b = 20;
```

But, JavaScript does not support `export` with `default` along with `const`. For example, below code is invalid.

```javascript
export default const a = 10, b = 20;
```

It is because we cannot identify which is the default out of `a` and `b` at the time of `import`.

Therefore, in case of constants we need to do the declaration and exporting in two different steps.

```javascript
const a = 10,
  b = 20;

export default a;
```

Due to this reason, if you try to export a function expression as default, it will not work. Below code does NOT work.

```javascript
export default const sum = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
}
```

If you do not like the `export default` to be on separate line, above code can be rewritten as:

```javascript
export default function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Above code is valid because `export default` can be used along with **expressions**, **functions** and **classes**.
