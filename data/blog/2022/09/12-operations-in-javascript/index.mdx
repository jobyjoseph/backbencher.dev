In JavaScript we can perform different operations like arithmetic operations and logical operations.

## Arithmetic Operations

We can add two or more numbers using `+` operator.

```javascript
2 + 3; // 5
2.3 + 1.4; // 3.7
```

We can subtract one number from another using `-` operator.

```javascript
5 - 3; // 2
2.3 - 1.4; // 0.9
```

> `2.3 - 1.4` in JavaScript returns `0.8999999999999999`. Why? That is a separate topic.

## Concatenation

When we use `+` operator with two strings, we can concatenate them.

```javascript
"Hello" + "Apple"; // "HelloApple"
```

## Operator and Operands

Consider following operation statement:

```javascript
2 + 3;
```

In that `2` and `3` are called operands. `+` is called operator.

In the above statement, `+` has two operands. Therefore, plus(`+`) is a **binary operator**.

## Negation Operator

Negation refers to opposite. If I have a value `true`, then negating it results in `false`.

```javascript
!true; // false
```

Any truthy value in JavaScript can be negated to `false`. Example:

```javascript
!1; // false
!"Apple"; // false
![]; // false
```

Similarly any falsy value can be negated to `true`. Example:

```javascript
!0; // true
!""; // true
```

In case of negation operator, there is only one operand involved. Therefore `!` operator is an **unary operator**.
