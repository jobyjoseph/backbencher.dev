There are few words which are part of JavaScript language. They have specific purpose in the language. Therefore they are also code **keywords**.

These keywords **should not be** used as the names for constants, variables, functions or classes. For example: `for` is an example of reserved word or keyword. If we try to name a variable as `for`, JavaScript will throw error.

```javascript
var for = 10;
```

Above code throws `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'for'` error.

  src={imgReservedWords}
  alt="Reserved word error"
  style={{ maxWidth: "500px" }}
/>

## Object Properties

Syntactically, it is ok to use reserved words as properties of objects. But it is best to avoid using that.

```javascript
var obj = {
  if: 23,
  for: "hello",
  while: true,
};
```

Even though above object has keywords as its properties, it is perfectly valid.

<Image
  src={imgObjectProperties}
  alt="Object properties"
  style={{ maxWidth: "500px" }}
/>

## Backward Compatibility

Some keyword like `let` was introduced in ES6. So there can be old code that uses `let` as a variable name. So for backward compatibility, declaring a variable with name `let` is allowed.

```javascript
var let = 10;
console.log(let); // 10
```

So can we declare a variable using `let` and the variable name as `let`? No.

```javascript
let let = 10; // SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word 'let'.
```

Since ES6, JavaScript engine knows the meaning of `let`. Therefore, it does not support variable declaration of `let` with `let` keyword. Same is the case with `class`. Classes were introduced in ES6. So, declaring a variable name `let` is not allowed inside a class.

```javascript
class Car {
  let let = 10; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token
}
```

## List of Reserved Words

Here is a list of keywords currently used in JavaScript:

```javascript
as
const
export
get
null
target
void
async
continue
extends
if
of
this
while
await
debugger
false
import
return
throw
with
break
default

true
yield
case
delete
for
instanceof
static
try
catch
do
from
let
super
typeof
class
else
function
new

```

Here is a list of reserved words for future use:

```javascript
