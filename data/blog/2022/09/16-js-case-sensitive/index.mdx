JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. That means JavaScript treats two words with same letters but different cases as two separate identifiers.

This applies to the language keywords, variables, function names and other identifiers.

## Keywords

`let` is a keyword in JavaScript to declare a variable. Here is an example of its usage.

```javascript
let a = 10;
```

Since keywords are case sensitive, all statements below are **not** valid.

```javascript
Let a = 10;
LET a = 10;
```

## Variables

Variables store values in JavaScript. Since variables are case sensitive, below code is creating 3 variables, not 1.

```javascript
let age = 10;
let Age = 10;
let AGE = 10;
```

## Functions

Functions are callable actions. We can group a set of statements under a function name. Here, we have two functions:

```javascript
// First function
function sum() {
  // some action
}

// Second function
function Sum() {
  // some action
}
```

Even though two functions have same name, they are declared separately due to different case.

## Switch Case

Here is another scenario where case sensitivity is demonstrated. `switch` keyword is used to pick a logic based on the input given to it.

```javascript
const a = "Apple";
switch (a) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("First case");
    break;
  case "Apple":
    console.log("Second case");
    break;
  default:
    break;
}
```

Since the value of `a` is `"Apple"` with a capital `A`, above code prints `"Second case"` as output.

## Identifiers

Other than above mentioned examples, case of an identifier is considered in using object properties, function arguments or class names.
