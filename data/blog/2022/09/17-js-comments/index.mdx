Comments in JavaScript is a piece of text that is not taken for execution. JavaScript engines ignore the comment text. Comments are purely for adding usability and readability of code.

## Single Line Comment

As the name tells, a _Single Line Comment_ is restricted to one line.

```javascript
// This is a single line comment

////// Another single line comment //////
```

Any text that comes between `//` and **end of the line** is ignored by the JavaScript engine.

## Multi Line Comment

We can also place a comment by wrapping the text between `/*` and `*/`. This enables having multi-line comment.

```javascript
/* This is a multiline comment.
It spans three lines.
Oh! I am the third line. */
```

### Nested Comment

Since the end of this comment is marked using `*/`, things will go wrong if we try to nest multiline comment.

```javascript
/* Parent comment starts
/* Nested comment */
Parent comment continues */
```

In the above example, the third line is not part of comment and will throw error.
