Today in my project, I had to destructure an object.

```javascript
const { facets, products } = response;
```

I wanted to give types to `facets` and `products`. Being a beginner in TypeScript, I first guessed and wrote like this:

```typescript
const { facets: any, products: any } = response;
```

What happens above is, the value of `facets` attribute from `response` is taken and assigned to `any`. The correct way to do it is:

```typescript
const { facets, products }: { facets: any; products: any } = category;
```
