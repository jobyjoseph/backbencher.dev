Previous day, all of a sudden my client's development site was not accessible. I was getting no access error page returned by CloudFlare. When checked with collegues, IPv6 was the blocker in my Macbook. As a solution, I had to **turn OFF IPv6** in my Mac.

I took _System Preferences > Network_. There I clicked on _Advanced_ option of _Wi-Fi_. Then under _TCP/IP_, I could see _Configure IPv6_ option. The problem is, there was no _Off_ option.

## networksetup Command

Then the following solution worked for me. I took the terminal. I ran following command.

```
networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi
```

It turned OFF my IPv6 and then I could see the _Off_ option in dropdown.
