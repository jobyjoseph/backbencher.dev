** Question: **

I have heard that in **hoisting**, the variable declaration is hoisted to top of the script or function. For example, I have a code snippet here:

```javascript
console.log(sport);
var sport = "cricket";
```

After hoisting, I am assuming the code will be like this:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var sport;
console.log(sport);
sport = "cricket";
```

If this is how hoisting works, who is actually doing the hoisting and moving the declaration to line 1?

** Answer: **

Actually, nobody is moving the variable declaration code literally to the top. It is a perception based on how the code works.

We know that JavaScript is an interpreted language. That means, each statement in the code is executed line by line. Before the execution, there is a **parsing** step. During this parsing step, the parser go through the full code and does few things like allocating memory for variables, define lexical scope and so on.

So in the original code with just 2 lines, when the parser sees `var` keyword next to `sport` in line 2, it allocates a memory location for `sport` and assign `undefined` value. Note that only allocation happens in parsing step, initialization will not happen.

After parsing, when the actual execution starts, the interpreter is trying to print the value of `sport` in the first line. The JavaScript engine checks if there is any memory allocated for `sport`. Yes, there is one allocated during parsing step. It prints the value at that moment which is `undefined`. Only when the interpreter jumps to second line, the value `"cricket"` is assigned to `sport`. This is how `console.log` is able to use the variable `sport` before it is declared in code.
