When working with mongoose and MongoDB, it is common thing to save a document and return the newly created document as the API response. Sometimes we have to modify the response before sending. That is what we are going to see here.

I got this info from a beautiful course in Udemy titled Microservices with Node JS and React.

We have a signup API that saves user data and returns it. Here is the mongoose userSchema.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
});
```

Without any modification, the signup API response looks like this.

```javascript
{
    "_id": "6055863ae572b800194d342a",
    "email": "joby@adsf.sd",
    "password": "2d91dac0bd33ec1e4d3cef2e297b2f7fea349dd2c594174e67cfecb07e465e7c7a8c26761e315fdbeb8bccd171cab2abcd84687738c5463636f23b1d43190a62.989c3332f75b5590",
    "__v": 0
}
```

We need to clean up the response. Following changes needs to be done in the response.

- Change `_id` key to `id`
- Remove `password` key
- Remove `__v` key

Mongoose schema supports a JSON filter. So, whenever a JSON response is send by a route, it calls this filter. This `toJSON` filter can be added to `userSchema` like below.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    password: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    toJSON: {
      transform(doc, ret) {
        ret.id = ret._id;
        delete ret._id;
        delete ret.password;
      },
      versionKey: false,
    },
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

`toJSON` accepts an object which contains the instruction to transform the API response. The logic written assigns `_id` to `id`. After that we delete `_id` and `password` fields. Then setting `versionKey` to `false` removes `__v` property. After doing all these, now the signup API returns response like below.

```javascript
{
    "email": "joby123@adsf.sd",
    "id": "605588229025fa002f88cac6"
}
```

This is how we can create clean and standardized API response when working with mongoose and MongoDB.
