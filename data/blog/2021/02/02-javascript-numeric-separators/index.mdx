Numeric separator(`_`) was introduced to make numbers more readable by creating a **visual separation** between groups of digits. The separator can be used with decimal, binary, hexadecimal or BigInt numbers. This feature was introduced in **ES12**.

It is difficult for humans to read large numbers quickly. What about 1000000000? Is it a billion or 10 million?. Numeric separators make developers' life easy.

```javascript
const num = 1000_000_000; // Definitely a billion
```

Numeric separator is purely for visual separation. It does not have any impact in the functionality. In fact, comparing a number with separator and that without it, results in `true`.

```javascript
console.log(1000_000_000 === 1000000000); // true
```

## Position of Separator

The numeric separator can appear anywhere **inside** the number. Following are valid usages of numeric separators.

```
1000_000_000
123_02
4567_00
3_4_5_6
```

Numeric separator is **not allowed** at the **end** of a number. Therefore, following number is invalid.

```
123_00_
```

Also, if a number **starts** with `_`, JavaScript treats it as a variable. In JavaScript, a variable can start with `_`.

```javascript
const a = _123;
```

Here `_123` is considered as a variable name. Since that variable is not declared, above code will throw _reference error_.

## Separators in Fractional Part

Numeric separators can be placed in the fractional part of a number.

```
12.300_00
1e10_10
```

## Examples

Here are some examples that consider different use cases of numeric separator.

### Binary Literal

A binary literal in JavaScript is denoted by prefixing a binary number by `0b`. While writing a binary literal, we can place numeric separator to make it more readable.

```javascript
console.log(0b11_1); // 7
console.log(0b111); // 7
```

`111` is the binary equivalent of decimal number `7`.

### Hex Literal

A Hexadecimal literal in JavaScript is denoted by prefixing a hexadecimal number by `0x`. We can include numeric separator in a hexadecimal number.

```javascript
console.log(0xf_f); // 255
console.log(0xa_b === 0xab); // true
```

Note that the decimal equivalent of `0xFF` is `255`.

### BigInt Literal

A BigInt literal can contain a numeric separator.

```javascript
const a = 1_309_89n;
console.log(typeof a); // "bigint"
console.log(a.toString()); // "130989"
```

If we place an underscore `_` between the number and final `n`, it will throw an error.

```javascript
const a = 1_309_89_n;
```

Above code results in following error:

```
SyntaxError: Numeric separators are not allowed at the end of numeric literals
```

## Browser Compatibility

All the major browsers support numeric separators. We can see the precise information by visiting this <Olink link="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_grammar_numeric_separators">CanIuse</Olink> link.
