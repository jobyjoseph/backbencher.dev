Nullish coalescing is an operator in JavaScript just like `+`, `*` and so on. The operator is written using two question marks(`??`). It take two operands. It returns second operand if first operand is `undefined` or `null`.

```javascript
undefined ?? "I am returned"; // "I am returned"
null ?? "I am returned"; // "I am returned"
false ?? "I am NOT returned"; // false
```

## Set Default

We usually assign default value to variables using OR(`||`) operator.

```javascript
var name = name || "Guest";
```

In this case, if `name` is any falsy value like `""` or `0`, `"Guest"` is set as the value. But we need to set `"Guest"` only if `name` is either `undefined` or `null`. In that case we can use `??` operator.

```javascript
var name = name ?? "Guest";
```

## Short-Circuiting

Like OR and AND operator, in case of Nullish Coalescing operator, the right hand side operand is only evaluated if left hand side is `undefined` or `null`.

```javascript
false ?? undefined(); // false
undefined ?? undefined(); // TypeError
```

## Chaining with AND or OR

Logical AND(`&&`) and OR(`||`) can be combined and used. But Nullish coalescing operator(`??`) cannot be chained with `&&` or `||`.

```javascript
null || undefined ?? "Hello"
```

Above line will throw SyntaxError. If there is such a case, we can modify the code like below to remove the error.

```javascript
(null || undefined) ?? "Hello";
```

Here we explicitly set the operator precedence using parenthesis.
