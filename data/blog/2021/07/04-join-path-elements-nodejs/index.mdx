**Path** module in Node.js provides utilities to work with file or directory paths. It can be accessed using:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
```

If we need to join different path segments to form a valid path string, we can use `path.join()`.

```javascript
const filePath = path.join("apple", "banana", "orange"); // apple/banana/orange
```

The separator used to join the path is platform specific. Based on the OS, `path.join()` automatically handles it.

All the arguments passed to `join()` should be a string. Otherwise, it will throw a _TypeError_.
