I am learning how to use React Query Dev Tools. When followed the tutorial, I faced this issue `TypeError: Cannot read property 'queries' of undefined`. As per the tutorial, they are importing `ReactQueryDevtools` from `react-query-devtools` package.

```javascript
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "react-query-devtools";
```

If we are working with React Query v3, we need to import from different package.

```javascript
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "react-query/devtools";
```

and then add `<ReactQueryDevtools />` immediately under `QueryClientProvider`.

```javascript
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <GitUsers />
  <ReactQueryDevtools />
</QueryClientProvider>
```
