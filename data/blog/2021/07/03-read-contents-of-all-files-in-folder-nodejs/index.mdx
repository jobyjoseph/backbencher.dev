Sometimes we require to read the contents of all files in a folder. It can be to pre-render static pages or for some other reason. Let us see how we can do that using Node.js.

Here `index.js` and `blog` directory are in same folder. Here are the contents of `index.js` file.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const blogPath = path.join(process.cwd(), "blog");
const filenames = fs.readdirSync(blogPath);
const filePosts = filenames.map((name) => {
  const fullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), "blog", name);
  const file = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8");
  console.log(file);
});
```

`path` and `fs` comes with Node.js. They are included on top.

`process.cwd()` returns current directory. `path.join()` returns the full path string.

`fs.readdirSync` gets all file names synchronously. `fs.readFileSync` gets the content of the file.
