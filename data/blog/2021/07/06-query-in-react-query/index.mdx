**Query** in React Query can be used to resolve promises and fetch data from an API. Here, we are fetching data from Github user search API.

First, import `useQuery` hook from `react-query`.

Now, in our functional component use the `useQuery` hook.

```javascript
const queryUsers = useQuery("gitUsers", () =>
  fetch("https://api.github.com/search/users?q=joby").then((res) => res.json())
);
```

Each time the status of request changes, we could see re-rendering of the component. We can print the value of `queryUsers` in console. The final value of `queryUsers` will be having the Github users.

This way of using useQuery will not work in React Query version 3. There we need to use `QueryClientProvider` along with `useQuery`.
