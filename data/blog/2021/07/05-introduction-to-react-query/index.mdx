React Query is used to work with Asynchronous data in React. It helps to fetch, cache and update data in React and React Native applications.

## Installation

React Query can be added in any project using:

```
yarn add react-query
```

## 3 Core Concepts

3 Core concepts in React Query are:

1. Queries
2. Mutations
3. Query Validation

A **query** is used to fetch data using `useQuery` hook.

**Mutations** are used to create/update/delete data in server. We use `useMutation` hook.

**Query Validation** helps to check if queries are stale and potentially refetch data. We use `useQueryClient` for query validation.
