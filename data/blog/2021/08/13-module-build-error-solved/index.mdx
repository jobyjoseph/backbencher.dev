import imageBuildError from "./images/module-build-error.png";

From my understanding, we can obtain this error in any **npm** project. I got this error when I was working with a _React Query_ project. The issue was launched to the project all of a sudden on a fine day. I had no idea what got changed. For me the error shown in the browser looked weird:

<Image src={imageBuildError} alt="Module Build Error" />

The issue was with the **mismatch** in package dependencies. I was working with React Query version 3. I then installed React Query Devtools version 2, which in turn required React Query version 2.

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "react-query": "^3.19.0",
    "react-query-devtools": "^2.6.3",
}
```

When I removed `react-query-devtools` and did a clean build, things started working.
