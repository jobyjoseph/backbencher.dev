import Olink from "../../../../src/components/olink";

<Olink link="https://material-ui.com/">React Material UI</Olink> is a CSS framework
using which we can build beautiful website in less time. In order to add React Material
UI to a Next.js app, first install the package.

```
yarn add @material-ui/core
```

Then, inside a page we can use it like below:

```javascript
import { Button } from "@material-ui/core";

export default function Home() {
  return <Button color="primary">Hello World</Button>;
}
```

Here we first import only the Button component from material-ui. Then we use it in our page.

> `Button` is a named import, not a default one. Keep that in mind to save time.
