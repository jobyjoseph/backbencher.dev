Query objects in React Query resolve promises and fetch data from an API. Query supports **initial data**. When an initial data is set, that data is displayed immediately till the actual data is ready.

Here we have setup an object that should be displayed immediately:

```javascript
const initialData = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: "First Name",
  },
];
```

Next, we pass above object when creating the Query:

```javascript
const userQuery = useQuery(
  "user",
  () =>
    fetch(
      "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?email=Sincere@april.biz"
    ).then((res) => res.json()),
  // highlight-start
  {
    initialData,
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

> If you are using a fast internet connection, you might not see the initialData. You can simulate a slow 2G connection in browser to view the working on `initialData`.
