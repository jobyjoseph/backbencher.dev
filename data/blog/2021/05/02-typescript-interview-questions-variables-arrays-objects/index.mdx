** Question: **

We have a JavaScript code that declares 3 variables and later assigns value to those variables.

```typescript
let car;
let model;
let isSedan;
car = "BMW";
model = 2018;
isSedan = true;
```

How can we add types to the declared variables using TypeScript syntax?

** Answer: **

We can add type information along with each variable declaration as shown below.

```typescript
let car: string;
let model: number;
let isSedan: boolean;
car = "BMW";
model = 2018;
isSedan = true;
```

`string`, `number` and `boolean` written above are called **Type Annotations**.

**Question:**

Here we have a variable declaration with no explicit type definition.

```typescript
let planet = "Earth";
planet = 3434;
```

Does the above code throws an error in TypeScript?

**Answer:**

Yes, above code throws error in TypeScript. When we do initialization along with declaration, TypeScript sets the type of variable as the assigned type. So, in our case, the type of `planet` is `string`. Therefore, it is not allowed to assign a number type to `planet`. Above code shows following error by TypeScript.

```shell
Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

** Question: **

When I tried running below code, I am getting an error.

```typescript
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 2.14;
```

The error thrown is:

```shell
Cannot assign to 'PI' because it is a constant.
```

What rule of TypeScript did we break?

** Answer: **

Actually TypeScript is a super set of JavaScript. This error is part of native JavaScript. In JavaScript, if we try to reassign to a const variable, it throws above error.

** Question: **

Here is an array in JavaScript that contains mixed data types. In the second line, we are pushing a boolean value to the array.

```javascript
const arr = [23, "Apple", 35];
arr.push(true);
```

Does that work?

** Answer: **

No, it does not work. Even though `arr` contains mixed types, TypeScript is not treating it as an array that can accept any data types. TypeScript is seeing it as an array that can accept only either `string` or `number`. The equivalent syntax in TypeScript is:

```typescript
const arr: (string | number)[] = [23, "Apple", 35];
```

That is the reason why `arr` is not accepting boolean value. If we want the array to accept any values, we need to explicitly mention that while declaring.

```typescript
const arr: any[] = [23, "Apple", 35];
```

** Question: **

Here we have an empty array.

```typescript
const arr = [];
```

Can we push values of any types to this array?

** Answer: **

Yes. Here, TypeScript implicitly provides the type as `any` to the array elements.

** Question: **

What is the meaning of following TypeScript code?

```typescript
const arr: [number, string, number] = [23, "Brooklyn", 57123];
```

** Answer: **

This is an example of Tuple. Tuple is an array of fixed length. Here we are defining a tuple and the type of each element in the tuple.

** Question: **

Here is a valid assignment to a variable in JavaScript.

```javascript
obj = {
  car: "BMW",
  model: 2021,
};
```

Please write down the type definition while declaring `obj` variable.

** Answer: **

If both properties `car` and `model` are mandatory in `obj`, the TypeScript type definition looks like below.

```typescript
let obj: { car: string; model: number };
```

If any of the properties in the object is optional, it can be represented using question mark `?`.

```typescript
let obj: { car: string; model?: number };
```

** Question: **

Here is a typescript code. Will it throw an error?

```typescript{numberLines: true}
let obj: { car: string; model?: number };
obj = {
  car: "BMW",
  type: "Sedan"
};
```

** Answer: **

Yes, it will throw an error. `type` is not part of defined type. Therefore, line 4 throws an error.

** Question: **

Here we have a TypeScript code.

```typescript
let obj1: { car: string; model?: number };
let obj2: { car: string; model?: number };
obj1 = {
  car: "BMW",
};
obj2 = {
  car: "Mercedes",
};
```

How can we improve above code?

** Answer: **

The type of `obj1` and `obj2` are same. We can define an interface and reuse it.

```typescript
interface Car {
  car: string;
  model?: number;
}

let obj1: Car;
let obj2: Car;
obj1 = {
  car: "BMW",
};
obj2 = {
  car: "Mercedes",
};
```
