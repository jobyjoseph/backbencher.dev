** Question: **

Give one example where we can use TypeScript Intersection?

** Answer: **

We have a variable `person` that can accept either a student object or a teacher object. The `Student` type and `Teacher` type is defined separately.

```typescript
interface Student {
  name: string;
  marks: number;
}

interface Teacher {
  name: string;
  salary: number;
}
```

Now based on some condition either a student object or teacher object is assigned to `person`. In that case `person` should be ready to accept either one of these objects. For that we use TypeScript Intersection.

```typescript
let person: Student | Teacher;

if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  person = {
    name: "Hanna",
    marks: 23,
  };
} else {
  person = {
    name: "Jenny",
    salary: 8900,
  };
}
```

In the first line, we can see the Intersection(`|`) operator. That will make `person` to accept either one of the types.

Once we use intersection operator, only the keys that are common to both types could be used there after. For eg, in the above code, `name` is the common property. So we can access `name`.

```typescript
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.marks); // Error
```

It is not sure if `person` will have `marks` property. So, TypeScript throws an error if we try to access it.

**Question:**

We have a TypeScript code here:

```typescript
interface Student {
  marks: number;
}

interface Teacher {
  salary: number;
}

let person: Student | Teacher;

if (true) {
  person = {
    marks: 23,
  };
} else {
  person = {
    salary: 8900,
  };
}

console.log(person.marks);
```

`marks` is present only in `Student`, not in `Teacher`. Therefore, does the last line throw an error?

** Answer: **

No. The `if` condition is checking for `true`. So TypeScript knows that the `else` block will never get executed. For that reason `person.marks` does not throw an error. If there was any chance to go to `else` block, then it will be an error.

**Question:**

What are **union** types in TypeScript? When do we use it?

**Answer:**

Union operator(`&`) is used in TypeScript to join the types from multiple types. Say we already have a type `Person`.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

We now need to define a `teacher` object, who is a person and also has some more teacher specific attribute.

```typescript
interface Teacher {
  school: string;
}

let teacher: Person & Teacher;
```

Now `teacher` variable should be an object that is a union of `Person` and `Teacher` type. That means, it is mandatory for `teacher` variable to have `name`, `age`, `school` properties. Absence of any property will result in error.

```typescript
teacher = {
  name: "John",
  age: 23,
  school: "Winterville",
};
```

** Question: **

What will happen if we use TypeScript union operator like this:

```typescript
let street: string & number;
street = 23;
```

** Answer: **

In line 1, we are declaring the type of `street` as both a string and number at the same time. Even though, such a condition cannot be met, TypeScript will not throw any error in line 1. TypeScript simply sets the type of `street` as `never`. `never` is a type that says, no value can be accepted.

Since the type of `street` is `never`, line 2 throws an error when we try to assign a `number` type to `never` type.

** Question: **

Here is a JavaScript variable `color`.

```javascript
let color;
color = "Red";
```

The variable can only contain either of 3 values: `"Red"`, `"Yellow"`, `"Green"`. How can we bring this restriction using TypeScript?

** Answer: **

This can be done using _intersection_ operator in TypeScript.

```typescript
let color: "Red" | "Yellow" | "Green";
color = "Red";
```

**Question:**

Here we have a function that accepts an object and returns an object.

```javascript
function setState(state) {
  const newState = { ...state, name: "John" };
  return newState;
}
```

The input and return object can have only 2 properties, `name` and `age`. How can we make sure the type safety using TypeScript?

**Answer:**

Since the argument type and return type of the function are same, it is good to create an interface first.

```typescript
interface IPerson {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}
```

Then set the type for function parameter and return type.

```typescript
function setState(state: IPerson): IPerson {
  const newState = { ...state, name: "John" };
  return newState;
}
```

**Question:**

We have a ES5 typed function.

```typescript
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

We need to convert above function to arrow function syntax. How can we do that?

**Answer:**

Here is the typed arrow function.

```typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b;
};
```

** Question: **

Here, we have a TypeScript function.

```typescript
function subscribe(accepted: "yes" | "no", email?: string): void {
  console.log(email);
}
```

My intention was, if the value passed to `accepted` is `"no"`, the second argument should not be passed. And if the value of `accepted` is `"yes"`, then the second argument `email` is mandatory. But the code snippet above is failing. It accepts `email`, even if the value of `accepted` is `"no"`. How can we fix it?

**Answer:**

Here we are talking about using the function with 2 different sets of inputs. One with only `"no"` and other with `"yes"` and `email`. So, what we need to do is function overloading. We need to define 2 separate signatures for TypeScript to understand. Here is how we need to do it:

```typescript
function subscribe(accepted: "no"): void;
function subscribe(accepted: "yes", email: string): void;

function subscribe(accepted: "yes" | "no", email?: string): void {
  console.log(email);
}
```

** Question: **

Here is a simple TypeScript code.

```typescript
function hello(this: string) {
  console.log(this);
}

hello();
```

Will it throw any error? If yes, please explain and how can we solve it.

** Answer: **

Yes. Above code throws an error.

When we define the type of `this`, TypeScript checks the value of invocation context when the function is invoked. When `hello()` is invoked, the value of `this` will be either `undefined` or `window` object. Both are not strings. That is the reason of the error.

In order to solve the error, we need to set the value of `this` explicitly using `call()`, `apply()` or `bind()`. Here is an example using `call()` that clears the error.

```typescript
function hello(this: string) {
  console.log(this);
}

hello.call("my string");
```

`call()` is a static method of `Function` object. The first parameter passed to it is set as the value of `this`.
