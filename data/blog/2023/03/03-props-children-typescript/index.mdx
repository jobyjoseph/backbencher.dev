In TypeScript, the type of `props.children` depends on the usage.

If `props.children` is expected to be a single React element, the type can be specified as `React.ReactNode`.

If `props.children` is expected to be an array of React elements, the type can be specified as `React.ReactNodeArray`.

For example, consider the following functional component:

```typescript
interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function MyComponent(props: Props) {
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
}
```

Here, `props.children` is expected to be a single React element, and its type is specified as `React.ReactNode`.
