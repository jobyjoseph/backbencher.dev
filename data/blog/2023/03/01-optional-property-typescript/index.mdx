In TypeScript, you can mark an object property as optional by using a question mark `?` after the property name. This indicates that the property is not required and can be omitted when creating or using objects that have this property.

Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const person1: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

const person2: Person = {
  name: "Bob",
};
```

In this example, the `Person` interface has an optional `age` property marked with a question mark. The `person1` object includes the `age` property, while the `person2` object omits it.

Note that when accessing an optional property, you should check whether it exists first to avoid runtime errors. You can use the `in` operator or the `typeof` operator to check for the existence of an optional property. For example:

```javascript
if ("age" in person1) {
  console.log(person1.age);
}

if (typeof person2.age === "number") {
  console.log(person2.age);
}
```
