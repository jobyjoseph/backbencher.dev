`utils.isArchivePath()` is a method provided by the `@serverless/core` library, which is a popular Node.js-based framework for building serverless applications.

This method is used to determine whether a given file path represents a compressed archive file, such as a ZIP or TAR file. It takes a file path as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the file is a valid archive file.

Here's an example of how to use `utils.isArchivePath()`:

```javascript
const { utils } = require("@serverless/core");

const filePath = "/path/to/archive.zip";
const isArchive = utils.isArchivePath(filePath);

if (isArchive) {
  // Do something with the archive file
} else {
  // Handle the case where the file is not an archive
}
```

Note that `utils.isArchivePath()` is specific to the `@serverless/core` library and is not a built-in method in Node.js or any other programming language or framework. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the `@serverless/core` framework to help build serverless applications.
