Interfaces defines the structure of an object. Here is a structure of a `Car` object using interface.

```typescript
interface Car {
  model: string;
  year: number;

  show(message: string): void;
}
```

Later we can create a class that **implements** the `Car` interface.

```typescript
class BMW implements Car {
  model: string;
  year: number;

  constructor(m: string, y: number) {
    this.model = m;
    this.year = y;
  }

  show(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

The keyword rightly tells `implements` because it is mandatory to implement all properties and methods listed in the interface.

It is ok to add more properties and methods to the class.
