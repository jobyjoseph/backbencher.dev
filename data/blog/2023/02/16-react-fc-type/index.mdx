If we are using TypeScript along with React, we might use `React.FC` type. `FC` stands for function component.

If we write a function that returns a React component, we can use this type.

```typescript
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
};
```

If the function does not return a React component, TypeScript will throw an error. Here is a function that will throw an error:

```typescript
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return "hello";
};
```

The error message will be:

```
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ReactElement<any, any>'
```

`React.FC` is the short version of `React.FunctionComponent`. We can use any type according to our convienience.
