An **interface** describes the structure of an **object**. We create an interface using `interface` keyword. `interface` keyword exists only in TypeScript, not in vanilla JavaScript.

Let us define the structure of a car object using interface.

```typescript
interface Car {
  model: string;
  year: number;
}
```

The interface contains the name of the properties present in the object and also the type of each properties.

We can also add details about methods present in the object. Say, we have a method `show()` in the `car` object. The method accepts a parameter, `message` which is a string. Also, the method returns nothing. Here is how we give the details of the method in our existing interface.

```typescript
interface Car {
  model: string;
  year: number;

  show(message: string): void;
}
```

Now we have an interface. The advantage now is that, when we declare a variable, say `car1`, we can set the type of `car1` as `Car`. That makes `car1` to accept only an object that follows the `Car` interface structure.

```typescript
let car1: Car;
```

At a later point, when we assign an object to `car1`, it should follow all the structure of `Car` interface as shown below:

```typescript
car1 = {
  model: "BMW",
  year: 2023,
  show: (message) => {
    console.log(message);
  },
};
```
