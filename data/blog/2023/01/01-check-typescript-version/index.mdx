TypeScript can be installed from NPM package library using:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Above command installs TypeScript globally. It installs `tsc` command which stands for TypeScript Compiler.

So, to check if TypeScript is installed properly in your machine, you can run:

```
tsc --version
```

If above command displays the compiler version like `Version 4.8.4`, you can confirm the presense of TypeScript.
