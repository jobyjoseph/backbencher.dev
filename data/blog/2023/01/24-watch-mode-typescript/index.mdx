When working with a single TypeScript file, we repeatedly compile the file using `tsc` command. We can use watch mode to automatically compile the file on change.

Here is how you can use watch mode:

```typescript
tsc app.ts --watch
```

You can also use shorter flag:

```typescript
tsc app.ts -w
```

In watch mode, even if there is a TypeScript error, it is logged in the terminal. Correcting the error will again recompile the output JavaScript file.
