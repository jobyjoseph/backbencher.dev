TypeScript has a type called `unknown`.

We have a variable here of type `unknown`.

```typescript
let input: unknown;
```

We give `unknown` type because we do not know the type of value, the user inputs.

## Difference between `any` and `unknown`?

We have a `any` variable and `string` variable below:

```typescript
let a: any;
let b: string;
a = 10;
b = a;
```

Above code does not throw error. `any` type can be assigned to another type like `string`.

Now, see the code below:

```typescript
let a: unknown;
let b: string;
a = 10;
b = a;
```

Now `b = a` throws error. A variable of `unknown` type is not allowed to assign to another type.

So, `unknown` is more restrictive than `any`.

## How to assign an unknown variable to string variable?

In order to assign a `unknown` type variable to `string` type, we need to explicitly check for string using JavaScript.

```typescript
let a: unknown;
let b: string;
a = 10;

if (typeof a === "string") {
  b = a;
}
```

Now, TypeScript will not throw any error.
