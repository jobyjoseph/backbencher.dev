In this article we discuss the core types supported by TypeScript.

## Number

First core type is `number`. In JavaScript or TypeScript, there is only one type that deals with numbers. There are no different types for integers, float or big numbers.

## String

All texts are of type `string`. String literals are created using double quotes, single quotes or back tick mark.

```
"This is a string"
'This is a string'
`This is a string`
```

## Boolean

`true` and `false` comes under `boolean` type.
