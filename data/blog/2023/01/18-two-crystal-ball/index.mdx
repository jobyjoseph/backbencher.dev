Here is the **Two Crystal Ball** problem:

Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough distance, determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimized way.

**Solution:**

To understand the problem, let us assume the crystal ball will break if dropped from a height of 8 meters. So, if we drop from 1 meter, the ball will not break(`0`). If dropped from height of 2 meter, again the ball will not break(`0`). We keep on doing it. When dropped from 8 meters, the ball will break(`1`). If we list all 0s and 1s in an array, it will look like below:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1...]
```

Basically, we want to find the first position of `1`.

Another point here, is the array is sorted.

Since there are two balls, we can use first ball to find an approximate breaking point by jumping by a certain amount in each loop(sqrt(n) in our case). We will do linear search in that interval to find the correct breaking position.

Here is the code:

```javascript
function twoCrystalBall(arr) {
  // Calculate jump length with sqrt of array length
  const jumpLength = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(arr.length));
  let i = 0;

  // Leaping through array with distance of jumplength in each leap
  for (; i < arr.length; i = i + jumpLength) {
    if (arr[i] == 1) {
      break;
    }
  }

  // Going back by one leap to start walking using linear search
  i = i - jumpLength;

  // Walk one by one using linear search
  for (let j = i; j < i + jumpLength; j++) {
    if (arr[j] == 1) {
      return j;
    }
  }

  // If reached here means, the ball is not breaking within this height
  return -1;
}
```

The Big O of this algorithm is `O(sqrt(n))`.
