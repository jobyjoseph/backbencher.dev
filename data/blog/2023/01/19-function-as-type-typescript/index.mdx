We can mark a variable to store only functions using Function type in TypeScript.

## Setting Function Type

Here is how we set `Function` type:

```typescript
let a: Function;
```

Here is a valid assignment:

```typescript
a = function () {};
```

Here is an invalid assignment:

```typescript
a = 10;
```

Now TypeScript compiler says:

```
Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'Function'.
```

## Function Type with more specifics

Here is a Function type that accepts two numbers and return a number.

```typescript
let a: (num1: number, num2: number) => number;
```

Now `a` can accept only a function that has two number parameters and that returns a number type. No other function formats are accepted.
