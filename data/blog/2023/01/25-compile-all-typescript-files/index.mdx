If there is only one TypeScript file, we can compile the file using:

```
tsc app.ts
```

Above command will compile the `app.ts` file and generate `app.js` file.

What if there are two or more TypeScript files, `app.ts` and `tag.ts`? In that case, first initialize the folder as a TypeScript project.

```
tsc --init
```

Above command creates a `tsconfig.json` file in the project root. If you open the `tsconfig.json` file, you can find several options you can pass to TypeScript compiler.

Next, from the project root folder, just run `tsc`. No file name or nothing, just `tsc`. It will create `.js` files for all `.ts` files.
