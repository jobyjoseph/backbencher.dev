When project get bigger `rootDir` and `outDir` helps to organize our project. One of the normal convention is to keep all source files in `src` folder and keep all distribution or the output files in `dist` folder.

We can follow similar approach in a TypeScript project. We can set `outDir` property in `tsconfig.json` to store all JS files in `dist` folder or any folder for that matter.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

The path or name of the output directory can be anything as you wish.

## Sub folder

When we set the `outDir`, it also maintains the folder structure. Say, if you have sub folders in the `src` folder, the same folder structure will be maintained in the output `dist` folder.

`rootDir` property tells the TypeScript compiler where to look for TypeScript files. If we store all the TypeScript files inside `src` folder, then it is good to set the `rootDir` to `./src`.

If we do not set the `rootDir`, TypeScript will compile TypeScript files in other folders or root folder and put everything in `dist` folder. That will break things.
