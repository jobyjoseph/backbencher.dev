Consider following line of code:

```javascript
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1");
```

There is a chance that the id `num1` does not exist. Due to that reason, TypeScript will throw an error. Now if we are sure that the element with id `num1` will be present, we can tell that to TypeScript using exclamation mark `!`.

```typescript
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")!;
```

The ending `!` tells that always there will be a value for `document.getElementById("num1")`.
