**Question**

What is _Preview Mode_ in Next.js? How does it help?

**Answer**

Preview mode helps to preview a web page before it is actually published. For example, if Next.js is showing product details page in an eCommerce website, the business team might need to preview before publishing a new product. So Next.js creates static pages for all published products and shows the preview page dynamically when requested.

**Question**

What are API Routes in Next.js?

**Answer**

API routes helps developer to create APIs using Next.js. API routes are defined inside `pages/api` folder.

**Question**

Inside `pages/api` folder in Next.js, we created a file `about.js` with following code.

```javascript
function About() {
  return <h1>About page</h1>;
}

export default About;
```

Assume that our app is running on `http://localhost:3000`, what will be the output when we visit `http://localhost:3000/api/about`?

**Answer**

We cannot see the `About` component. All endpoints under `/api` should resolve by sending back a response explicitly. In this case, we see a page which will be loading forever.
