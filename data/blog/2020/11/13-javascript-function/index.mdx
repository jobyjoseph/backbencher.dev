Functions in JavaScript are a special kind of **object**. Function is an object that contains executable code. A function can be **invoked** to run that executable code and **return** a value.

Here is an example of a function.

```javascript
function display() {
  console.log("Backbencher");
  console.log("JavaScript");
  console.log("Coding is fun");
}
```

In this function, `display` is the name of the function and the function contains 3 statements. The task to do for these statements is to print 3 strings to the console. So, when we call or invoke this function, it prints 3 texts to the console with the help of `console.log` method. `display` function is not calculating any value, instead it is performing a task.

We can also write functions to calculate a value and return the result. Here is a function `sum()` that calculates the sum of 2 numbers and returns the result.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The function `sum()` can be used whenever we need to add 2 numbers. Therefore, functions help us in reusing code.

## Defining Function

A function needs to be first defined to be called later. We can define a function using following ways in JavaScript.

### Function declaration

Here we are defining a function using `function` keyword. The format is:

```javascript
function <function name>(argument1, argument2, ...) {
  // function body
}
```

Here is an example.

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

### Function Expression

When we assign a function to a variable using assignment operator(`=`), a function expression is formed.

```javascript
var sum = function (num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
};
```

### Functions are True Values

Functions in JavaScript are true values. It means functions in JavaScript can be treated like regular objects.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
sum.myProperty = "Hello";
console.log(sum.myProperty); // "Hello"
```

Here we added a new property to `sum()` just like a regular object.
