import imageGlobalThisNode from "./images/globalthis-nodejs.png";

We all know that in a browser, the global object is `window`. In Node.js context, the global object is `global`. In a web worker, the global object is called `self`. ES2020 `globalThis` is trying to solve this different naming convention problem across different run time environments.

We are going to execute below code in a browser and Node.js environment.

```javascript
console.log(globalThis);
```

Here is the output in browser.

<Image
  src={imageGlobalThisBrowser}
  alt="globalThis in Browser"
  caption="globalThis value in browser"
/>

Here is the browser in Nodejs.

<Image
  src={imageGlobalThisNode}
  alt="globalThis in Nodejs"
  caption="globalThis value in Node.js"
/>

So this addition is a one keyword solution to access global environment in any context.
