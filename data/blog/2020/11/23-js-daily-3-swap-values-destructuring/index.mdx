import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a);
```

<Divider />

Output will be **20**.

This is an example of destructuring in JavaScript. In line 3, the left hand side is not an array. Instead, it is a pattern given to isolate the values of right hand side array.

In line 3, each element of left hand side pattern, ie `a` and `b` are assigned values from the array `[b, a]` in the same order. So the value of `b`, ie 20 is now assigned to variable `a`. And value of `a`, ie 10 is now assigned to variable `b`. Like this, it is now easy to swap values of two variables easily.

> Sometimes, you may have this question: In line 3, first `b` is assigned to `a`. Then next, when `a` is assigned to `b`, then the new value of `a` is assigned to `b`. But that wont happen. The destructuring is completed in one go in a unidirectional manner. So, without much complexity, you can imagine that all the values from right hand side is copied one by one to the variables in left hand side.
