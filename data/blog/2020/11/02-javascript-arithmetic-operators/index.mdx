Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on their operands.

## Multiplication

The asteriks(`*`) operator is used to **multipy** two numbers.

```javascript
console.log(2 * 3); // 6
```

Since, the multiplication operator can be used **only** with numbers, any **non-numeric** operand results in **Not a Number**(`NaN`).

```javascript
console.log(2 * "A"); // NaN
```

## Division

The forward slash(`/`) operator is used to **divide** two numbers.

```javascript
console.log(6 / 2); // 3
```

By default all numbers in JavaScript are handled as **floating-point** numbers. Therefore, the division result can contain **decimal** places.

```javascript
console.log(5 / 3); // 1.6666666666666667
```

The division operator works only with numbers. If any of the operands is a non-numeric value, the result results in `NaN`.

```javascript
console.log(5 / "A"); // NaN
```

In JavaScript, there are two special keywords to mark the both ends of number line, `Infinity` and `-Infinity`. When we try to divide any number by `0`, the result is `Infinity` or `-Infinity` based on the numerator.

```javascript
console.log(1 / 0); // Infinity
console.log(-1 / 0); // -Infinity
```

If the numerator is `0`, the result of division is always `0`.

```javascript
console.log(0 / 4); // 0
```

What happens when we divide a `0` by `0`? Will the answer be `0` or `Infinity`? May be, to avoid this debate, JavaScript returns `NaN`, if we try to divide `0` by `0`.

```javascript
console.log(0 / 0); // NaN
```

Division operator works only with numbers. If the operands can be converted to a valid number, then JavaScript does automatic conversion before doing the division. If the operands cannot be converted to a valid number, the result will be `NaN`.

```javascript
console.log(4 / "2"); // 2
console.log(4 / "A"); // NaN
```

## Modulo

In order to find the remainder of a division operation, we can use **modulo**(`%`) operator.

```javascript
console.log(10 % 4); // 2
```

The **sign** of the result is the sign of the first operand. The remainder will be **negative** if the first operand is negative. The remainder will be **positive** integer, if the first operand is positive.

```javascript
console.log(5 % 2); // 1
console.log(-5 % 2); // -1
console.log(4 % 2); // 0
```

In JavaScript, modulo operator works with **floating point numbers** also. But most of the time, we use modulo operator with integers.

```javascript
console.log(5.1 % 2.3); // 0.5
```

## Subtraction

The subtraction operator(`-`) is used to find the difference between two numbers.

```javascript
console.log(5 - 3); // 2
```

Subtraction operator works only with numbers. So if any of the operands cannot be converted to a number, the result will be `NaN`.

```javascript
console.log(5 - "A"); // NaN
```

## Addition

In JavaScript, `+` is used to add two numbers. The operator `+` is overloaded. That means, it behaves differently based on the type of operands. If both the operands are numbers, `+` performs addition.

```javascript
console.log(3 + 4); // 7
```

If any of the operands is not a number, then the result is calculated based on following rules.

If **both the operands are strings**, it performs concatenation.

```javascript
console.log("Apple" + "Banana"); // "AppleBanana"
```

In any other case, **type conversion** is required. `+` operator gives more priority to **string concatenation**. If either of the operands is a string or an object that can be converted to a string, all operands are converted to string and string concatenation is performed. In all other cases, that is if both operands are not strings or can be converted to strings, addition operation is performed.

Let us consider different cases.

If one of the operand is a string, other operands are also converted to string and string concatenation is done.

```javascript
console.log("A" + 2); // "A2"
```

If one of the operand is an object, that can be converted to a string, the string concatenation occurs.

```javascript
console.log([2, 3] + 5); // "2,35"
```

If none of the operands can be converted to a string, addition occurs. `null` and `undefined` cannot be converted to a string.

```javascript
console.log(3 + null); // 0
console.log(3 + undefined); // NaN
```

When addition is done, all operands are converted to numbers. `null` converts to 0 and `undefined` converts to `NaN`.

The `+` operator has **left-to-right** associativity. Consider the following statement.

```javascript
console.log(2 + 4 + "Hello"); // "6Hello"
console.log(2 + (4 + "Hello")); // "24Hello"
```

First line first performs number addition of `2` and `4`. The result `6` is then concatenated with `"Hello"`. Whereas in the second line the default associativity is altered using paranthesis.
