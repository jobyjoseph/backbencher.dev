import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log("A");
setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);
console.log("C");
```

<Divider />

In the console, we see the output in following order:

```
"A"
"C"
"B"
```

This is an example of how **call stack** and **event loop** works. The delay is set to 0 for the `setTimeout()` function. Still, `"B"` is not printed immediately after `"A"`. What happens is, line 1 prints `"A"`. Line 2 then executes `setTimeout()` and it will set the callback function to executed later after the specified delay(Even if delay is 0). Then the control goes to line 3 and prints `"C"`. After printing `"C"`, the callstack is now empty to take and execute more functions. At that time, the callback function of `setTimeout()` is brought to callstack and executed. That prints `"B"` in the console.
