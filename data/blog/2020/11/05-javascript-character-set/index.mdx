JavaScript programs are written using **Unicode** character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and supports most of languages in the world.

> Unicode is a standard for consistent representation of text maintained by Unicode Consortium. Unicode Consortium is a non-profit organization based in Mountain View California.

## Non English Text

Let us try to print a Japanese text using `console.log()` statement. I translated `"hope"` to Japanese using Google translate and it says the Japanese is `Nozomu`.

```javascript
console.log("望む");
```

Above code prints the Japanese text just like that in console.

```
望む
```

Since JavaScript supports Unicode character set, it also possible to use foreign languages as **variable names**.

```javascript
const പേര് = "Backbencher";
console.log(പേര്); // "Backbencher"
```

Above code used a word from Malayalam language as an identifier. That is also valid in JavaScript.

## Escape Sequence

Due to either hardware or software limitations, if we are not able input a particular unicode character, we can make use of escape sequence. Any unicode character in JavaScript can be represented using **6 characters**. 6 characters include a `\`, `u` and 4 hexa decimal characters.

```javascript
console.log("\u2764"); // "❤"
```

Above code logs a heart symbol in console.

Another useful case is to write **latin alphabets**. How to write an `é`?. We can make use of unicode in this case.

```javascript
console.log("\u00e9"); // "é"
```

According to JavaScript engine, both `é` and `\u00e9` are same.

```javascript
console.log("é" === "\u00e9"); // true
```

## Normalization

We can write a character in multiple ways using Unicode. Let us take the case of `é`. It can be written as a single unicode character as seen above.

```javascript
console.log("\u00e9"); // "é"
```

`é` can also be written by combining the normal ASCII `e` with the **acute accent combining mark(`\u0301`)**. The combining mark adds the dash on any normal characters.

```javascript
console.log("e\u0301"); // "é"
console.log("f\u0301"); // "f́"
```

Even though both techniques produces the same output, they are not equal internally.

```javascript
console.log("\u00e9" === "e\u0301"); // false
```

## Unicode Application

Even though we can use unicode to declare variables or as string literals, its direct usage is very rare. I have not seen anyone giving a Japanese word as variable name. When we declare a variable for maximum readability, it is good to choose English language.

There can be scenarios when we need to insert a special character like copyright symbol. In that case if use unicode, we might save inserting an additional image.

```javascript
console.log("\u00A9"); // "©"
```
