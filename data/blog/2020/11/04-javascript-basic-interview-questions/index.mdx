** Question: **

How are functions stored in memory by JavaScript? Here we have a function `sum()`.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

How `sum()` function is stored in memory?

** Answer: **

JavaScript allocates a memory block, just like a memory is allocated for a variable. The definition of the function is then stored inside the variable. That is why if we print the value of `sum` in console, it prints out the full source code of the function.

```javascript
console.log(sum);
```

Here is the console output:

<Image
  src={imageFnConsole}
  style={{ maxWidth: "200px", display: "block", margin: "auto" }}
  alt="Printing function in console"
/>

** Question: **

Is JavaScript single threaded or multi-threaded?

** Answer: **

JavaScript is single threaded. That means, it can execute one and only one part of the code at a time. If a code block calls a function, the block needs to wait until the function finishes its execution.

**Question:**

What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?

**Answer:**

`undefined` denotes a variable that is declared, but not yet initialized. In JavaScript, if we declare a variable and prints it value, the output will be `undefined`.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
```

On the other hand, `null` represents an intentional absense of an object. For example, the `match()` method in JavaScript returns all matches of a regular expression as an array.

```javascript
var str = "some things are awesome";
var res = str.match(/some/g);
console.log(res); // ["some", "some"]
```

We can see that the `match()` method returns an array, which is an object. So we expect an object from `match()` method. But what if, there is no match? In that case, `null` is returned to denote intentional absense of an object.

```javascript
var str = "some things are awesome";
var res = str.match(/boom/g);
console.log(res); // null
```
