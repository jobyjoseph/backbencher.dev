import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const str = "Backbencher";
console.log(!!str);
```

<Divider />

The output is `true`.

This is the easiest way to convert any value to its equivalent boolean value. First negation(`!`) converts the value to boolean, but it will be inversed. We then use one more negation to invert the value again.
