title: JS Daily 20 - Return From Constructor Function

decription: If the return value from a constructor function is an object, always that object is returned as the instance object.

import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
function Car(name) {
  this.name = name;
  return "BMW";
}

const carObj = new Car("Mercedes");
console.log(carObj.name);
```

<Divider />

The output is `"Mercedes"`.

Here the constructor function `Car()` is explicitly returning a string value. But that is ignored when used with `new` keyword. The newly created instance object is assigned to `carObj`. Therefore `carObj.name` outputs `"Mercedes"`.

> If the returned value is an **object** instead of `"BMW"`, then that object is assigned to `carObj`. The newly created object is ignored.
