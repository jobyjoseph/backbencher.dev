import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const a;
a = 10;
a = 20;
console.log(a);
```

<Divider />

Above code throws error in line 1. The error says `SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration`.

A `const` variable should be initialized at the time of declaration itself like `const a = 10`.
