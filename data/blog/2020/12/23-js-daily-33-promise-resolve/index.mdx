import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve();
  resolve();
  resolve();
});

p1.then(() => {
  console.log("Resolved");
});
```

<Divider />

The output is:

```
"Resolved"
```

Even though `resolve()` is called 3 times, the code will be resolved only once. That is how promises work.

Same is the case with `reject()`. Even if the code is rejected multiple times, `.catch()` will be called only once.
