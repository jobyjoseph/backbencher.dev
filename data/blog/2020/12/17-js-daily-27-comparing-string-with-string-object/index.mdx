import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const a = "Backbencher";
const b = new String("Backbencher");
console.log(a === b);
```

<Divider />

The output is `false`.

`a` and `b` are not strictly equal. When `===` is used, if both **type** and **value** of operands are same, the return value is `true`. The type of `a` is _string_ and that of `b` is _object_. Therefore `a === b` returns `false`.
