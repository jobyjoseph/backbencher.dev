import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log( 10 + "2");
```

<Divider />

Output is `"102"`.

Plus operator `+` in JavaScript can be used for numeric addition or string concatenation. When one of the operands is of **string** type, `+` does concatenation. Therefore, in this example `10` is converted to a string and the output is `"102"`.
