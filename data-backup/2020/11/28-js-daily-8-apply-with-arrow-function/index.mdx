import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const f = () => {
  console.log(this.a);
}
f.apply({ a: 10 });
```

<Divider />

Output is `undefined`.

In case of arrow function, `this` is not bound to the function. This rule is applicable even when used with `call()` or `apply()`.

In our example, `f()` is defined in the global scope(`window`). Therefore in line 2, when `this.a` is printed, it prints the value of `window.a`. Since, there is no global variable `a`, `undefined` is printed.
