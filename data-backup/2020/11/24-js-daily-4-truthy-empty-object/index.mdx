import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
if({}) {
  console.log("I am true");
} else {
  console.log("I am false");
}
```

<Divider />

Output will be **I am true**.

Any object in JavaScript, when converted to a boolean value, results in `true`. It can even be an empty object, as shown in the question.

> Since Array is also a type of object, empty array(`[]`) also converts to `true` in boolean.
