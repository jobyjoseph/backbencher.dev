import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const result = false || "Hello";
console.log(result);
```

<Divider />

Output is `"Hello"`. Output is not `true` as in some other programming languages.

Logical OR operator returns the **deciding value** in the logical chain. Here, the first value is `false`. So, the _OR_ operator needs to check the next value. The next value, `"Hello"` is a truthy value that makes the overall OR statement `true`. Therefore `"Hello"` is returned and assigned to `result`.

If all the values in the logical OR statement is falsy, then `result` will be `false`.
