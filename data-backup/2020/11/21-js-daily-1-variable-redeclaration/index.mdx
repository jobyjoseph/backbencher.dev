import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 6;
let a = 8;
console.log(a);
```

<Divider />

`let` was introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables in JavaScript. If a variable with the same name is already declared in the same scope, `let` throws an error. Here second line throws below error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```

This behaviour is explained <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-let-and-const-declarations-static-semantics-early-errors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> in ECMAScript.
