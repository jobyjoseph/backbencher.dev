** Question: **

How are functions stored in memory by JavaScript? Here we have a function `sum()`.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

How `sum()` function is stored in memory?

** Answer: **

JavaScript allocates a memory block, just like a memory is allocated for a variable. The definition of the function is then stored inside the variable. That is why if we print the value of `sum` in console, it prints out the full source code of the function.

```javascript
console.log(sum);
```

Here is the console output:

<Image
  src={imageFnConsole}
  style={{ maxWidth: "200px", display: "block", margin: "auto" }}
  alt="Printing function in console"
/>

<Divider />

** Question: **

Does a function always return a value?

** Answer: **

Yes. If there is a `return` statement, that value is returned. If there is no `return` statement, the function implicitly returns `undefined`.

Here is a function that explicitly returns a number.

```javascript
function f() {
  return 7;
}
const result = f();
console.log(result); // 7
```

Here is a function that does not have `return` statement.

```javascript
function f() {
  var a = 7;
}
const result = f();
console.log(result); // undefined
```
