import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log(a);
let a = 10;
```

<Divider />

The output is:

```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
```

Variables declared using `let` are not hoisted. During the parsing step, JavaScript is aware about the variable. But, till line 2, it will keep the variable in _Temporal Dead Zone_. That means, we cannot use the code before the variable declaration, as mentioned in the error message.
