import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
function xyz({name = "Rock", age = 20}) {
  console.log(name, age);
}
xyz({name: "Joe"});
```

<Divider />

Output is:

```
"Joe"
20
```

This is an example of providing named arguments to a function. This is achieved using **object destructuring**. The value of arguments are mapped from the passed object. If a property is not passed(`age`), the default value assigned is taken.
