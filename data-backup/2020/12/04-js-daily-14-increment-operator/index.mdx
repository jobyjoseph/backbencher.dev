import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 10;
console.log(a++);
console.log(++a);
```

<Divider />

The output is:

```
10
12
```

Post increment operator first prints the value(`10`) and then increments `a` to 11. Pre increment first increments the value and then prints. So the 11 is first incremented to `12` and then printed to console.
