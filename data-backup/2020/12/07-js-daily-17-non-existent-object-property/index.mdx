import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const obj = {
  name: "Backbencher"
}
console.log(obj.age);
```

<Divider />

The output is `undefined`.

`obj` is an object literal. We are trying to access the value of a property that is not present in `obj`. It results in `undefined`.
