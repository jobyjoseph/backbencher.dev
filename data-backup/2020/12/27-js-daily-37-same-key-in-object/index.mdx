import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const obj = {
  a: "Apple",
  b: "Banana",
  a: "Orange"
}
console.log(obj);
```

<Divider />

The output is:

```
{
  a: "Orange",
  b: "Banana"
}
```

In the example above, `"Apple"` and `"Orange"` are assigned to same object key(`a`). In such cases, last value assigned is saved to the key. That is why `"Orange"` is in key `a`.
