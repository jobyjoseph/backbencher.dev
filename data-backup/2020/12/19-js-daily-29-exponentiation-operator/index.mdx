import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log( 2 ** 10);
```

<Divider />

The output is `1024`.

Exponentiation operator(`**`) calculates the power of a number. In the example the `**` returns the 10th power of 2, ie 1024. This operator is the shorthand version of `Math.pow()`.
