import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
function Car(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
}

Car.showName = function() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const myCar = new Car("BMW", "Black");
myCar.showName();
```

<Divider />

The output is an error, specifically a **TypeError**. It looks like this:

```
TypeError: myCar.showName is not a function
```

Functions in JavaScript are also objects. That is why, functions have properties like `name` and methods like `call()` and `apply()`. Just like the built-in properties and methods, we can add new properties or methods to a function. That is what we did in the above code.

Now, when we attach a method directly to a function as in line 6, it is just for that function. It will not be available to instance objects like `myCar`. If we want a method to be available for instance objects, we need to attach that to the function prototype.

```javascript
Car.prototype.showName = function () {
  // ...
};
```
