import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const a = {};
const b = true;
a[b] = 20;
a["true"] = 30;
console.log(a[true]);
```

<Divider />

The output is `30`.

`a` contains an empty object. `b` contains a boolean `true` value. This `b` is then used as a key in object `a`. An object key is always a **string**. So the boolean `true` is converted to string `"true"`. Therefore in line 3, 20 is assigned to `a["true"]`.

In line 4, the value 20 is replaced by 30 in the position `a["true"]`.

In line 5, we are printing the value of `a[true]`. As we already mentioned, object keys will be always of string type. Therefore, `a[true]` is same as `a["true"]`. That is why, it prints 30 as output.
