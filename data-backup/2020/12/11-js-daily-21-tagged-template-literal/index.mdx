import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const formatString = (strings, ...values) => {
  return strings.join(",") + values.join(",");
}

const name = "Backbencher";
const age = 2;

const result = formatString `${name} is ${age} years old`;

console.log(result);
```

<Divider />

Output is `", is , years oldBackbencher,2"`

This is an example of Tagged Template literal. Here the template literal string is sliced and passed to the tagged function(`formatString`).

At first the string is sliced like `|${name}| is |${age}| years old`. Then all the string literals are grouped to one array(`["", " is ", " years old"]`). The values are picked and send to the function as second argument, third argument and so on. We gather all the arguments except first, using `...values`. So now `values` contains an array of 2 elements.

The return value of the `formatString()` call, is assigned to `result`.
