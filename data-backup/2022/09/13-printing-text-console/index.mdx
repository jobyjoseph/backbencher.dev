When writing Java code, if we want to print something in the terminal, we can make use of `System.out.println()`.

Here is a program that prints `"Hello World!"` in the terminal.

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

Here is the output:

```
Hello World!
```

## Display Variables

`System.out.println()` can also take variables. We might need to print the output of an expression or the variable for debugging.

Here is a program that adds two numbers and prints the sum:

```java
int sum = 2 + 3;
System.out.println(sum);
```

Here is the output:

```
5
```

## println vs print

Similar to `println()`, there is another method called `print()`. The difference is, `println()` automatically adds a new line after printing the message. That is not done by `print()`.

Here is a set of 3 `System.out.println()` statements:

```java
System.out.println("Apple");
System.out.println("Banana");
System.out.println("Orange");
```

Each printing will be done in separate lines.

```
Apple
Banana
Orange
```

Whereas, let us try the same three lines using `System.out.print()`:

```java
System.out.print("Apple");
System.out.print("Banana");
System.out.print("Orange");
```

Here is the output:

```
AppleBananaOrange
```
