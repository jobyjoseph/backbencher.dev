We have a Java code that prints `"apple"` in terminal.

```java
System.out.print("apple");
```

In your terminal you might see the output with a percent symbol attached. Why?

<Image
  src={imgEndingPercent}
  alt="Ending percent"
  style={{ maxWidth: "150px" }}
/>

This extra percent symbol is added by `zsh` terminal. When (non-null) output from a program doesn't include a trailing newline, zsh adds that color-inverted `%` to indicate that and moves to the next line before printing the prompt.

If the next command prompt is displayed along with the output as shown below it will be awkward and difficult to read.

```
appleprojects >
```

Instead `zsh` notifies the developer about the absense of trailing new line using the `%` and then move the prompt to next line.
