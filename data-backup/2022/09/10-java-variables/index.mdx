Variables are used to store values. Each variable can be treated as a box in which we can put something. The name of the box(like black box / wooden box) can be treated as the **variable name**. The something that we put inside the box can be treated as the **value** assigned to the variable.

Here is an example of creating a integer variable(`age`). Integer variable can store only integer values like `24`.

```java
int age = 24;
```

## Naming Convention

Best followed naming convention of variables is to follow **lowerCamelCase**. It means the name starts with a lowercase letter. If there are subsequent words, they start with capital letters.

Here are some examples:

```java
age
calculateAge
calculateFileSizeWithoutComments
```

> Class names are in CamelCase. Example: `HelloWorld`. But variable names are in lowerCamelCase.

## Strongly Typed

Java is strongly typed. If a type of variable is defined, the variable can accept only that type. A string value cannot be assigned to an integer variable.

```java
int a = "hello";
```

Above code throws this error during build step: `error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int`.

## Case Sensitive

Java is case sensitive. A variable declared using one case is different from that using different case.

```java
int A = 10;
a = 20;
```

Above code throws this error: `error: cannot find symbol a`. That is because `A` and `a` are not same and the variable `a` is not defined.

## Updating Variables

Once a variable is declared, we can update the value to another one of the same type.

```java
int a = 10;
a = 20;
```

If the value updated is of different type, Java throws incompatible types error which we saw above.
