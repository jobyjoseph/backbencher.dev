`getServerSideProps()` function is always rendered on the **server side**. The function never runs on the browser. So it is safe to use sensitive data inside `getServerSideProps()`.

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const credentials = "some secret";

  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}
```

Even though we can use secure data inside `getServerSideProps()`, we should not place any secure data in the returned `props` object.

## Rendering Techniques

Say, we have a page, `/ssr` which contains `getServerSideProps()` function. Therefore this page is always server side rendered. Here is the code for the page:

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      fruit: "Apple",
    },
  };
}

export default function SSR({ fruit }) {
  return <h1>Hello {fruit}</h1>;
}
```

Now, this url `/ssr` can be visited in two ways:

1. By directly visiting `example.com/ssr` directly(Server Side Rendering)
2. By clicking a Next.js Link or Router in some other page(Client Side Rendering)

### Server Side Rendering

In Server Side Rendering, Next.js will construct the full page in server. That means, `getServerSideProps()` will pass the `props` to `SSR` component in the server itself. The `{fruit}` placeholder will be replaced by the value `"Apple"` in the server itself. Finally the full HTML is created and send back to browser.

If a page is server side rendered, you can see the full source code when we view the page's source.

<Image src={imgViewSource} alt="View Source" style={{ maxWidth: "500px" }} />

### Client Side Rendering

When we navigate to `/ssr` page by clicking a Next.js link, client side rendering occurs. That means, Next.js will do client side routing to `/ssr` and loads the `SSR` component first. When I say, `SSR` component, I mean only the code shown below:

```javascript
export default function SSR({ fruit }) {
  return <h1>Hello {fruit}</h1>;
}
```

If you observe the browser network tab, as soon as you click the Next.js link, you can see a call made to `ssr.js`. That is the component loading part which I mentioned.

Once the component is loaded, Next.js bundle will request for the page data by making another request to `ssr.json`. When server receives this request, it runs the `getServerSideProps()` function and returns the `props` object as the JSON response.

Later Next.js hydrates or fills the `SSR` component with the data received in the client side. This is how client side rendering works.

In order to test the client side rendering part, I added a Next link in home page. Then I clicked on the link to watch the network tab.

<Image src={imgClientSide} alt="Client side rendering" />

Here is the response of `ssr.json` file:

```json
{ "pageProps": { "fruit": "Apple" }, "__N_SSP": true }
```

> `getServerSideProps()` can only be exported from a page. If we define it another file and import in a page, there will not be any error. But the page simply dont work. Next.js identifies a page for server side rendering by watching for `getServerSideProps()`.
