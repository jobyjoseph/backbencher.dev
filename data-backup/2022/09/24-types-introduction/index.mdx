The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as **types**. The types supported by a language is important when it comes to **operations on values** and also for **memory management**.

## Primitive and Object Types

JavaScript types can be divided into two, _primitive types_ and _object types_.

There are **6** primitive types:

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol

Any value in JavaScript that is not a primitive type is an object. A value which is of type object contains properties where each property has a name and value. The value can be either a primitive one or an object. Here is an example of object value:

```javascript
{
    name: "John",
    age: 24,
    address: {
        street: "Stoney peak",
        apt: 199
    }
}
```
