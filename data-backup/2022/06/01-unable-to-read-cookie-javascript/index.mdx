import Image from "../../../../src/components/image";
import imgHttpOnly from "./images/httponly.png";

In JavaScript we can create, read or update the value of cookie using `document.cookie`. Below code prints all the cookies of the site separated by semi-colon.

```javascript
console.log(document.cookie);
```

But, a cookie that is set as `HttpOnly` will not be there in the list. The server that sends the HTTP response decides if a cookie needs to be `HttpOnly` or not, by adding the attribute to the end of `Set-Cookie` header.

```
Set-Cookie: <name>=<value>[; <Max-Age>=<age>]
[; expires=<date>][; domain=<domain_name>]
[; path=<some_path>][; secure][; HttpOnly]
```

So if you find a working cookie code failing suddenly, this can be the reason. Check with the backend team if they had done any changes.

In Chrome, a HttpOnly cookie is marked with a tick mark in the cookies list.

<Image src={imgHttpOnly} alt="HTTP Only" />
