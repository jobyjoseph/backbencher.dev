The goal of this article is to learn how to **setup** and **compile** a TypeScript program. We use `tsc` compiler command to perform the compilation. We also learn how to set the **level of JavaScript** that comes out of TypeScript compiler.

## Project Setup

Create a folder anywhere to store the project files. I have created a folder named `ts-intro`. Inside the folder, create 3 files.

1. `package.json`
2. `tsconfig.json`
3. `src/index.ts`

#### package.json

We need only one dependency for this project. That is `typescript`. So, here is how our `package.json` looks like.

```json
{
  "name": "ts-intro",
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.5.5"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc --watch --preserveWatchOutput"
  }
}
```

The `dev` command will run the TypeScript compiler(`tsc`) along with some options. `--watch` flag watches for any file change and does compilation again if there is any source file change. `--preserveWatchOutput` is to retain the console outputs even after re-compilation.
Now, that is it about `package.json` file. Let us understand the second file, `tsconfig.json`.

#### tsconfig.json

When we run `tsc` command, if a `tsconfig.json` file is there, TypeScript will parse that file for options. The settings in the file is applied during TypeScript compilation. Here is our `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "target": "ES3"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

We are passing 2 compiler options. `outDir` is for output directory. Here, we are telling TypeScript to store the output in `dist` directory. If we does not specify this option, TypeScript by default puts the output JavaScript file alongside the TypeScript files. Keeping a separate output directory makes development easier.

If we want the output JavaScript to support ES3 browsers(Eg: IE6), then we need to set the value of `target` to `ES3`. Note that, more backward compatibility means the generated JavaScript files will contain more code. So, we do not have to set this option to older versions unnecessarily.

By mentioning `"src"` in `include` array, we specify that all our TypeScript files will be in `src` folder. `--watch` flag will be watching for any file changes under the `src` folder.

> We can pass all compiler options as command line flags. But as the project gets bigger, having a separate config file is easier to manage and version.

#### src/index.ts

We are going to write our TypeScript code in this `index.ts` file. First, paste below code to `index.ts` file.

```javascript
let a = 10;
```

What we are going to test is:

- Will TypeScript converts this ES6 code with `let` keyword to an ES3 code?
- Will TypeScript saves the output JavaScript code under `/dist` folder?

Before starting the execution, we need to install the packages. For that navigate to project folder in terminal and run:

```
npm install
```

Above command will install `typescript` dependency. Once installation is complete, run the `dev` script using:

```
npm run dev
```

I could see `/dist` folder getting created. Inside the `dist` folder, an `index.js` file is present with following code:

```javascript
var a = 10;
```

As we can see, TypeScript converted the `let` keyword to `var` for ES3 compatibility. What if we update the `target` value in `tsconfig.json` to `ES6`? Then `let` keyword is kept as such in the output JavaScript file.

##### TypeScript Code

So far we tried only JavaScript code in `index.ts` file. Let us try a simple TypeScript code.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Our aim is to restrict `add()` function to accept only numbers. After compilation the output JavaScript file contains following code:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Wait! Where is the type check? I was expecting TypeScript to add type checking code like:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  if (typeof a === "number" && typeof b === "number") return a + b;
  else return "error";
}
```

That will not happen. TypeScript is a **static type checker**. It does not do any code logic modification. Example, how can TypeScript decide what to do if an error occurs? Does it need to return a string with `"error"` or throw some exception. All these confusions will occur. So TypeScript will do only **build time type check with the annotations given to it**.

For example, in the above TypeScript code if we call the function with a string value like below, TypeScript can identify the error at build time itself.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add("a", "b");
```

Now TypeScript will throw below error in terminal:

```
src/index.ts:5:5 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

5 add("a", "b");
```

## Summary

We learned how to setup a simple project that can compile TypeScript files. We learned how to provide compiler options using `tsconfig.json` file. We understood how Static Type checking works in case of TypeScript. This article can be a starting point for further TypeScript experiments.
