A tambola sheet consist of 3 rows and 9 columns. We are going to develop a cell in tambola using HTML and CSS.

## Outline

Each cell is constructed using a `div` tag. A class `tambola-cell` is given to the `div` for styling.

```html
<div class="tambola-cell"></div>
```

Let us set the width and height of the cell to be 40px and a border color of black, `#000`.

```css
.tambola-cell {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 2px solid #000;
}
```

<Image
  src={imgEmptySquare}
  alt="Empty tambola cell"
  style={{ maxWidth: "60px" }}
/>

A cell in tambola game can be in different states:

- Empty cell
- Cell with a number that is not called
- Cell with a number that is called

We completed the design of empty cell. Next we need to design a cell with a number.

## Number Styling

The tambola number should be big and readable. Let us update our HTML first.

```html
<div class="tambola-cell">90</div>
```

The number also needs to be centered vertically and horizontally.

```css
.tambola-cell {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 2px solid #000;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

Here is how the cell with number looks like.

<Image
  src={imgCellWithNumber}
  alt="Cell With Number"
  style={{ maxWidth: "60px" }}
/>

When the user marks a cell as called, we can give a green background to the cell. We add a new class `called-number` to mark the cell as _called_.

```html
<div class="tambola-cell called-number">90</div>
```

Here is the CSS for green background.

```css
.called-number {
  background: #66bb6a;
}
```

Here is the output of a called number.

<Image src={imgCalledNumber} alt="Called Number" style={{ maxWidth: "60px" }} />
