A `.gitignore` file in project root folder tells Git, what all files to ignore from tracking. Here is a list that can be included in `.gitignore` file in a normal React project.

## .gitignore

Before working with `.gitignore`, ensure that you have initialized your project as a git repository using `git init`. Create a `.gitignore` file in project root and fill it with below content.

```
node_modules/
.cache/
dist/
.env
.DS_Store
coverage/
.vscode/
```

`node_modules/` folder need not be pushed to Git server. It will be big and unnecessary to push it. All the package details are there in `package.json` file. We only need that file to be pushed to Git server to later build and run the application.

`.cache/` is added to ignore temporary cache files generated by bundlers. If, for your bundler like Parcel or Webpack, the cache name is different, rename this folder name in `.gitignore`.

`dist/` is the common name to store the output of a build process. We do not have to push the output of a build to Git. If we need to deploy the app, we take a fresh build at that time from source files.

`.env` contains secure environment variables and values. We do not want it to be shared with others.

`coverage/` folder is generated as part of code coverage testing. That need not be there in the Git.

`.vscode/` folder is created by Visual Studio Code IDE. It stores project specific settings. We do not want this folder to be pushed to Git server.
