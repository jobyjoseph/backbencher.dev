We can install TypeScript using Node Package Manager(NPM). NPM is automatically installed when you install Node.js. You can check if `npm` command is available in your machine by running:

```
npm --version
```

If `npm` is installed, above command will display the version number like `8.15.0`. If `npm` command is not available, you can install Node.js from their official site.

## Global Installation

If you want TypeScript to run anywhere in the terminal, it needs to be installed globally. Global TypeScript installation can be done using:

```
npm i -g typescript
```

If the above command run successfully, then you can try below command to verify the installation:

```
tsc --version
```

It displays the version of TypeScript like `Version 4.8.4`.

## Local Installation

When we install TypeScript within the scope of a project, that is called local installation. When we install locally, we will not use `-g` flag.

```
npm i typescript
```

Once we start using TypeScript in any project, we use above command. In that case, TypeScript package will be locally stored under `node_modules` of the project.

We then run `tsc` command from `package.json` script command.
