**Number** is the primary numeric type in JavaScript. Number value consists of both **integers** and **real numbers**.

```java
// Integers
23
34171
0
-45
-98172

// Real numbers
1.57
-0.871
```

> In programming languages like Java, they have separate data types to handle integers and real numbers.

## 64 Bit

Any number in JavaScript is represented using **64 bits floating point** format. That means any number in JavaScript takes 64 bit of memory. As an example, number `6` is stored in memory as shown below:

```java
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000110
```

Since we have 64 bits, the largest numbers which can be represented are `±1.7976931348623157 × 10`<sup>`308`</sup>. And the smallest number that can be represented are `±5 × 10`<sup>`−324`</sup>.
