import { Link } from "gatsby";

I am using Visual Studio Code to write this blog. I created a custom component to be used in <Link to="/articles/react-interview-questions">React Interview Questions</Link> page. A problem which I faced was when using a markdown syntax inside a JSX component, the markdown is not getting rendered.

For that the solution is to put an extra line after and before the JSX component tags. But, Prettier automatically removes the extra line on saving the file. Then I looked for ways to prevent auto formatting only for `.mdx` files.

The solution is very easy. I had to add a `.prettierignore` file in my Gatsby project root. Then I added below content in that file.

```
*.mdx
```

The prettier plugin in Visual Studio Code respects that and will prevent auto formatting of `.mdx` files.
