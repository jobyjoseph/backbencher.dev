Next.js is a React framework to build web application. Next.js creates page routes based on file and folder structure. We can also set and handle dynamic pages in Next.js.

## Handle Dynamic Path

We can find dynamic paths everywhere. If we consider `petco.com`, the product url for "Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach & Skin Chicken Recipe Dry Dog Food, 30 lbs" is:

```
https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/hills-science-diet-adult-sensitive-stomach-and-skin-chicken-recipe-dry-dog-food
```

And the product url for "Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach & Skin Small Bites Chicken Recipe Dry Dog Food, 15 lbs., Bag" is:

```
https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/hills-science-diet-adult-sensitive-stomach-and-skin-small-bites-chicken-recipe-dry-dog-food
```

If you observe above urls, only the last portion changes.

If we need to build a structure like petco's using Next.js, we need to create a folder structure like:

```
pages
|_shop
  |_en
    |_petcostore
      |_product
        |_[slug].js

```

In this case `slug` is kind of a placeholder that takes the value that comes after `/shop/en/petcostore/product`.

Inside `[slug].js`, we can read the value of `slug` as follows:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const Product = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return <h1>Product: {slug}</h1>;
};

export default Product;
```

The value of `slug` can be retrieved from Next.js router object.

## Multi Level Dynamic Path

What if we need a dynamic url like below:

```
example.com/posts/<category>/<sort_order>
```

In this case we need to create the folder structure like below:

```
pages
|_posts
  |_[category]
    |_[sort_order].js
```

Note that we have given the `category` folder name inside square brackets. And inside `[sort_order].js` we can read the values of `category` and `sort_order` like below:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const Product = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { category, sort_order } = router.query;

  return (
    <h1>
      Product: {category} | {sort_order}
    </h1>
  );
};
```
