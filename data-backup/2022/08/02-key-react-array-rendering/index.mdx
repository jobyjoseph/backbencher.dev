import { Link } from "gatsby";

You have an array of React components. You are trying to render it using a loop. While running the application, everything looks good. But in the browser console you see this error:

```
VM9:85 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `App`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
```

> This error message appears only when we use development version of React file. We will not see this error in production.

## How to solve this error

The `key` issue can be solved by adding a `key` attribute to each Array components. Here is an example that renders 3 components from an array.

```javascript
[<Student key="1" />, <Address key="2" />, <PIN key="3" />];
```

This is how we need to add the `key` to remove the warning.

## Why React needs the key

In simple terms, let me see how to put this. Observe the array below with 3 components.

```javascript
[<Student />, <Address />, <PIN />];
```

React can render above component. No issue. But if we swap the `Address` and `PIN` component, React needs to re-render the entire array. If the `key` attribute is there, React will keep a record of that. Then it can swap `Address` and `PIN` without re-rendering `Student` component.
