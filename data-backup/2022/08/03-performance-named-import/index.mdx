import { Link } from "gatsby";

In a JavaScript or Node.js project, we can `import` modules using different ways. Here are two examples which we discuss today.

```javascript
// Default import
import Lodash from "lodash";
Lodash.capitalize("hello");

// Named import
import { capitalize } from "lodash";
capitalize("hello");
```

Lodash is just an example used to demonstrate the performance. We all know that lodash contains several utility methods.

Both the types of `import` works. But the performance of both techniques vary based on the bundler we use. Different bundlers use the different ways for **tree shaking**.

> Tree shaking is the process taken by bundlers to find out what all methods or modules need to be included in the output bundle.

It is always advised to use **named imports**. It makes sure that only the required modules are loaded to the output bundle.
