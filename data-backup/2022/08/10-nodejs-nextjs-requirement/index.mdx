Next.js is an isomorphic application framework created on top of React. It requires **Node.js version 12.22.0 or higher** to run Next.js.

For a safer side, I suggest you to check the required version directly on <Olink link="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#system-requirements">Next.js website</Olink>. You can find it under _System Requirements_ of Next.js.

If you are using an old version of Node.js, you can download the latest from the <Olink link="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js website</Olink>.

At the time of writing, the required Node version for Next.js is _v12.22.0_ and latest Node.js LTS version is _v16.17.0_. So, in most of the case, the Node.js in your machine will meet the system requirements of Next.js.
