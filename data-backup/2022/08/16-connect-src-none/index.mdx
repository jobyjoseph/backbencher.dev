import Olink from "../../../../src/components/olink";

Last day, while working on my client project, all of a sudden I saw a new error in console, at least for me it was new. It said "Refused to connect to URL because it violates the following content security policy directive: 'connect-src none'".

I tried to understand it by creating a POC.

First of all `connect-src none` is a new way to bring more security to web pages. It is part of the new **Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header**. Using this new header, we can declaratively bring different levels of security.

> We can try Content-Security-Policy either through HTTP response header or by placing `meta` tag in the page.

I tried using `meta` tag.

## Connect-src Demo

Our aim is to restrict a web page from making AJAX calls.

For that, create a web page `index.html`. Add the below `meta` tag in the page.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="connect-src 'none'" />
```

Next, we place a `fetch` request in the page:

```javascript
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5500/data.json")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

Note that my `data.json` is in my same server. When I run my page, I will see below error in console:

```
Refused to connect to 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/data.json' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'none'".
```

That means, since I set the value of `connect-src` to `none`, no fetch call can happen from the page.

Now let us change the value of `none` to `self`.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="connect-src 'self'" />
```

Now I could see the JSON data. Now let us change the API url to an external open API.

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

It now throws below error in console.

```
Refused to connect to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self'".
```

That means, if the value of `connect-src` is `self`, a fetch call will work only if the domains are same.
