`fs` module is part of Node.js framework. We can read to and write from files using `fs` methods. We discuss how to use relative paths with `fs` module.

## Path module

`path` is another module in Node.js. It is used to resolve paths. We can use `path` to use relative paths with `fs` module.

For that, first import both modules.

```javascript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
```

Then create the path to file using relative syntax as shown below. This is just an example.

```javascript
let filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, "../../../path/to/file.txt");
```

Then we can pass this path to `fs` to read or write as shown below

```javascript
fs.readFileSync(filePath);
```
