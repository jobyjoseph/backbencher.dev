Here is the problem. We have a currency value that is greater than `999`. Some write such big currency values using comma separators.

```
"1,567,782.23"
"1,000,000"
```

In JavaScript, sometimes we need to remove all the commas for further logic. There are multiple techniques. We are discussing, two string methods that can perform the job.

## replaceAll()

It is a comparitively new string method. It was added to ECMAScript in ES2021. Using `replaceAll()`, we can remove all commas like below:

```javascript
const withCommas = "1,567,782.23";

const withoutCommas = withCommas.replaceAll(",", "");
console.log(withoutCommas); // "1567782.23"
```

## replace()

`replace()` method is comparitively old and can be used with more confidence and platform support. It uses regular expression to find patterns and replace them.

```javascript
const withCommas = "1,567,782.23";

const withoutCommas = withCommas.replace(/,/g, "");
console.log(withoutCommas); // "1567782.23"
```
