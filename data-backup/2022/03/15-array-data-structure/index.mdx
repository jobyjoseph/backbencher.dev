An **array** is a collection of similar items stored in **contigous memory locations**. We discuss here about arrays in the context of JavaScript language.


## Create an Array

In JavaScript, an array of 10 elements can be created using:

```javascript
const arr = new Array(10);
```

## Read Array Element

Each element in an array has an index starting from **0**. An array element can be obtained using its index. Therefore, 5th element of the array can be accessed using:

```javascript
console.log(arr[4]); // 5th element is in 4th index
```

## Read All Elements

We can use a `for` loop to iterate through an array.

```javascript
const arr = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

We can also use array `forEach()` method to iterate through an array.

```javascript
const arr = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"];

arr.forEach(function (item) {
  console.log(item);
});
```
