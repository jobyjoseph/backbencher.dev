If I need to open a file or folder in Visual Studio Code, I use `code` command. It was working fine for long. All of a sudden, it stopped working.

## Reason

The exact reason why it stopped working, I am not sure. I doubt it has something to do with VS code software update.

## Solution

Every time when I get this issue below solution worked for me.

Click _Shift+Cmd+P_ to open the command pallete.

Search for `Shell command: Uninstall code command from PATH`. Run that command. It will remove the code command from PATH.

Then, search for `Shell command: Install code command in PATH`. It will install it again.

For uninstalling and installing, it will ask your root permissions.

After that the `code` command starts working from any terminal.
