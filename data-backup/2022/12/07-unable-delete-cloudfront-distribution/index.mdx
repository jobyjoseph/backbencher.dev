In order to delete a CloudFront Distribution, first it needs to **disabled**.

Immediately after disabling a CloudFront distribution, we **cannot delete it**. The change needs to be propogated to all nodes. After all nodes are cleared, we can see the date in **Last modified** column.

If you can see the date means, you can delete that cloudfront distribution.
