We have learned that Array is a data structure that stores its elements in contiogous memory locations. Look the code below:

```javascript
const arr = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
```

Are these 3 elements stored in contigous memories? No. Even though JavaScript arrays perform lot of operations just like arrays, in the core it is just another key-value object. Why?

In JavaScript, if an array contains 6 elements, these 6 elements can be of any data type. Due to that, it is not possible for compiler to decide a set of contigous memories for an array.

If we really need to work with a contigous memories, go for _ArrayBuffer_. Search for ArrayBuffer in JavaScript to know more.
