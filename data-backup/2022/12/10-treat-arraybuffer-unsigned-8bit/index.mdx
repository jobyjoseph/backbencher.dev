We have an ArrayBuffer with 8 bytes.

```javascript
const a = new ArrayBuffer(8);
```

If we print `a` now using node.js, this is what we see in console.

```
ArrayBuffer {
  [Uint8Contents]: <00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>,
  byteLength: 8
}
```

`00` is the default value assigned.

If we want to treat the zeros or the binary numbers stored in the array buffer as 8 bit integers, we need to use `Uint8Array`.

```javascript
const num8array = new Uint8Array(a);
```

Now we can treat `num8array` as an 8 bit integer array with contigous memory. Here is how we can play with the new array.

```javascript
num8array[1] = 34;
console.log(num8array);
```

The output will be:

```
Uint8Array(8) [
  0, 34, 0, 0,
  0,  0, 0, 0
]
```
