I am using `@sls-next/serverless-component` to deploy Next.js application to AWS. Everything was working fine.But today when I tried for a new Next.js application, I am seeing below error.

```
Serverless Components CLI v1 is no longer bundled with Serverless Framework CLI
```

<Image src={imgServerlessCli} alt="Serverless CLI issue" />

The issue was with respect to the mismatch between the `@sls-next` component and main `serverless` component. I got it resolved by using an older version of `serverless`. I used version 2.72.2.

```
npx serverless@2.72.2
```
