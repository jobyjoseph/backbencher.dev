Next.js is a React framework to create isomorphic applications. In this article we learn how to

- Create a Next.js application
- Setup AWS to host our Next.js application
- Use Serverless package to host our application to Lambda

## Create Next.js Application

In order to spin up a Next.js application in our machine, we first need to install Node.js. You can test if Node.js is installed in your machine by typing following command:

```
node -v
```

It should return the version number of installed Node like `v14.15.0`. If it is not installed, go and install Node.js first. Once Node.js is ready, navigate to a folder where you want Next.js app to be setup. Then run following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

When running above command, it will ask for the project name. A folder will be then created with this name and all the files are put inside that folder. My app's name is `my-nextjs-app`.

Now Next.js app is ready. We can go into the app folder and run `yarn dev` to see the running site.

## AWS Setup

We need to create an AWS user that has necessary privileges to host the application in AWS Lambda. For that, we need to create an IAM user. This step is like any other IAM user creation. Nothing special. So if you dont know how to create an IAM user, check this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

I am listing out some details which I gave while creating my IAM user. My user id is `serverless`. I gave `AdministratorAccess` policy to this user. Now this user has all the power to do whatever it wants in AWS.

In the last step of user creation, we get an access ID and secret key for `serverless` user. Save it safely somewhere.

Now we have a user who is ready to take our Next.js code and host it in Lambda. Next, we need to install AWS-CLI(Command Line Interface) in our laptop and configure it. Then only any tool in the future, if it wants to do something in AWS using `serverless` user, it can make use of aws-cli commands to perform the same.

### AWS CLI

Best way to install AWS CLI is to follow the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). It lists out OS specific documentation to setup AWS-CLI. Please complete it.

Once AWS CLI is installed, you can check if it is installed correctly by running following command:

```
aws --version
```

It should return something like this:

```
aws-cli/2.2.31 Python/3.8.8 Darwin/19.6.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

After AWS-CLI installation, you need to configure it by following this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html). During the configuration step, you provide the user credentials like access ID and secret. The AWS-CLI then remembers it and uses it for future transactions.

The AWS configure command looks like this:

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

During configuration process, AWS is storing the credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` file in plain text. We can view the output and see our credentials.

<Image src={imgAWSCredentials} alt="AWS Credentials" />

In the credentials file, we can see `[default]`. That is the profile name. We can add more profiles like that. Later, when we execute Serverless framework, we can tell which profile to use.

In the next section, we are going to use a package called `serverless` that makes use of the aws credentials and host our Next.js app in AWS Lambda.

## Serverless in Action

[Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework make development, deployment and running serverless application very easy. The framework contains code that can push our application to most of the serverless solutions out there like AWS, Google cloud and Azure. In this demo, we are going to use AWS.

Serverless is a general framework that helps to host any applications to any serverless solutions. In order to host a Next.js application, there is a serverless component particularly created for Next.js. It is open source and known as [Serverless Next.js Component](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js).

We are going to use Serverless Next.js Component.

### serverless.yml

In order to use Serverless framework, we need to have a `serverless.yml` in the root folder of the project. It is going to have all the configurations. Create this file in our Next.js root folder, ie in the same level as of parent `package.json` file.

In the yml file, add the following content:

```
myNextApplication:
  component: "@sls-next/serverless-component@latest"
```

### Deploy Script

In package.json file, add one more command for deploy:

```
"deploy": "serverless --aws-profile default"
```

Now when we run `npm run deploy`, serverless framework starts running. The framework uses the credentials of AWS `default` profile.

We now have all the main ingredients ready. Let us go to terminal and run below command from our app root folder.

```
npm run deploy
```

This command now runs `Serverless` and do all steps and configure our application in AWS. The Serverless Next.js Component finally shows the cloudfront URL in the console along with other details.

If we take the cloudfront url, `https://d1h3cs35iia2hn.cloudfront.net` in browser, we can see the deployed Next.js application.

## Technical Summary

Next.js application requires server side rendering of React. Here, Serverless Next.js Component is deploying our app to _Lambda@Edge_ which has the capability to execute Lambda code at CDN edges.

Serverless.yml is converted to a valid _Cloud Formation_ file by Serverless. The entire deployment process is then conducted based on the steps provided by this Cloud Formation file.

Once Next.js app is built, we get some chunk of Javascript files and other files. These files are stored in a S3 bucket by the Serverless and the bucket id is displayed in the console(in the screenshot above) after deployment.
