** Question: **

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const numbers = {
  numberA: 5,
  numberB: 10,

  sum: function() {
    console.log(this === numbers);

    function calculate() {
      console.log(this === numbers);
      return this.numberA + this.numberB;
    }

    return calculate();
  }
};

console.log(numbers.sum());
```

** Answer: **

Line 1 defines an object `numbers`. Line 17 invokes a method `sum()` of the object. We can see the dot(`.`) operator to call the `sum()` method. That tells that `sum()` is called in the context of the object `numbers`.

Once the execution enters into `sum()`, it reaches the first `console.log` statement(Line 6). There `this` points to the context `numbers` because as we said earlier, `sum()` is invoked in `numbers` context. So Line 6 outputs `true`.

In Line 8, there is a function definition for `calculate()`. And calculate is invoked in line 13. Even though `calculate` function is written inside `sum()`, according to JavaScript engine, it is simply a named function stored in memory. In Line 13, we call `calculate()` as a normal function. So `calculate()` is invoked in global context, ie `window` in non-strict mode.

When calling `calculate()` in line 13, execution reaches line 9. There `this` points to `window`. Therefore in line 9, `console.log` prints false, since `window` is not equal to `numbers`.

In line 10, since `this` points to `window`, `window.numberA` and `window.numberB` are `undefined`. So `calculate()` returns `NaN` because adding two `undefined` results in `NaN`. This `NaN` is then printed by line 17.

Finally in the console we see:

```
true
false
NaN
```
