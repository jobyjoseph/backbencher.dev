JavaScript uses semi-colon(`;`) to separate two statements.

```javascript
var a;
let b;
```

In JavaScript, if we omit the semi-colon, JavaScript intelligently understands end of statements.

```javascript
var a = 6;
console.log(a); // 6
```

In the above code JavaScript parser first takes `var` and then check if adding next phrase makes any sense. `var a` is a valid statement. The engine does not stop there. It will check if the next part can also be appended. `var a =` makes sense only if there is a value or expression after `=`. We have `6` which is valid value. Now, the statement looks like `var a = 6`. Again, JavaScript checks if appending next line makes sense. `var a = 6 console.log(a)` is not a valid statement. So JavaScript, automatically inserts a semi-colon after `6`. So our code after parsing looks like:

```javascript
var a = 6;
console.log(a);
```

It is always good to explicitly put semicolon. Consider the following code.

```javascript
var a = b(x + y).toString();
```

If we tried to insert 2 statements, that wont work. JavaScript engine consider above code like below.

```javascript
var a = b(x + y).toString();
```

## return, break and continue

There are 2 exceptions to the automatic semicolon insertion by JavaScript.

The first exception involves `return`, `break` and `continue`. Let us consider following code.

```javascript
return;
true;
```

The second line can be considered as continuation of first line. But JavaScript does not do that. It places a semicolon immediately after `return`.

```javascript
return;
true;
```

So if we want to write the return value in separate lines, place a `(` as a starting point in the same line of `return`. That makes JavaScript to parse the full `()` block and return it.

```javascript
return a + b;
```

This line break issue is with `break` and `continue` also;

## Unary increment and decrement operators

The second exception to auto semicolon insertion is with unary increment and decrement operators.

How the code below works?

```javascript
x;
++y;
```

It is parsed as `x; ++y;`, not as `x++; y;`. Anyways, I have not seen any developer writing unary operators in separate lines. Still, it is fun to know this weird behaviour of JavaScript.
