Relational operators test for a relationship such as equal to, less than and so on. Relational operators return `true` or `false` depending on whether the relationship exists.

```javascript
console.log(2 < 3); // true
```

## Equality and Inequality Operators

### Equality(==)

Equality(`==`) operator checks if two values are same. The two operands can be of **any type**. If two operands are of different types, JavaScript converts both operands to same type and performs the equality check. Let us understand how `==` operator performs comparison.

If both operands are of same type and if their values are same, then equality(`==`) operator returns `true`.

If both operands are of different types, equality(`==`) operator applies a set of rules to determine equality.

If one value is `null` and other `undefined`, they are equal.

```javascript
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

If one value is number and other one a string, the string value is converted to number and then the comparison is performed.

```javascript
console.log(3 == "3"); // true
```

If either of the operands is `true`, it is converted to `1`. If the operand is `false`, it is converted to `0`. After that the comparison is performed.

```javascript
console.log(true == 1); // true
console.log(true == "true"); // false
console.log(false == 0); // true
console.log(false == "false");
false;
```

In the above example, note that when `true` is compared with `"true"`, it retured `false`. In a relational operation, `true` and `false` are always converted to **numbers**.

If either of the operands is an object and other operand is a number or string, the object is converted to a primitive type using `valueOf()` or `toString()` method of the object. Then the comparison takes place.

```javascript
console.log([2, 4, 6] == "2,4,6"); // true
```

Above statement is true because an array is converted to a string by joining its elements with comma(`,`).

### Strict Equality(===)

Strict Equality(`===`) operator returns `true` only if the **value** and **type** of both operands are same.

```javascript
console.log(3 === 3); // true
console.log(3 === "3"); // false
```

### Inequality(!=)

Inequality operator(`!=`) returns `true` if both operands are not equal according to equality operator(`==`).

```javascript
console.log(3 != 4); // true
```

### Strict Inequality(!==)

Strict Inequality operator(`!==`) returns `true` if both operands are not equal according to strict equality operator(`===`).

```javascript
console.log(3 !== "3"); // true
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators test the relative order of their operands. Relative order is calculated based on number or alphabets. There are 4 comparison operators.

### Less than(<)

The `<` operator evaluates to `true` if its first operand is less than the second one. Otherwise it returns `false`.

```javascript
console.log(1 < 2); // true
console.log(4 < 1); // false
console.log("A" < "a"); // true
```

When `"A"` is compared `"a"`, their ASCII codes are compared. ASCII code of `"A"` is 65 and of `"a"` is 97.

### Greater than(>)

The `>` operator evaluates to `true` if its first operand is greater than the second one. Otherwise it returns `false`.

```javascript
console.log(6 > 4); // true
```

### Less than or Equal to(<=)

The `<=` operator evaluates to `true` if its first operand is less than or equal to the second one. Otherwise it returns `false`.

```javascript
console.log(4 <= 4); // true
```

### Greater than or Equal to(<=)

The `>=` operator evaluates to `true` if its first operand is greater than or equal to second one. Otherwise it returns `false`.

```javascript
console.log(6 >= 4); // true
console.log(4 >= 4); // true
console.log(3 >= 4); // false
```
