`useQuery` hook handles promises in React Query. If the promise throws an error, the query object provides a `isError` property to detect that. The query object also provides an `error` property that contains the actual error object.

We can therefore handle loading, error and success cases like below:

```javascript
return queryUsers.isLoading
  ? "Loading..."
  : queryUsers.isError
  ? queryUsers.error.message
  : "Success";
```

Here `queryUsers` contain the query object created by `useQuery()` hook.
