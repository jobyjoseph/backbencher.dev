I was starting with a Next.js project. In order to create a project structure we have a NPM package `create-next-app`.

In order to use `create-next-app` command, we now don't have to install it globally. Instead we can use `npx` command.

```
npx create-next-app
```

Using `npx` can also avoid permission related issues when running global packages.
