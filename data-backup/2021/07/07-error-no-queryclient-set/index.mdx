import Image from "../../../../src/components/image";
import imgQueryError from "./images/error-no-queryclient-set.png";

I just started learning a React Query course. I installed `react-query` package as instructed. The first video itself in the course, threw an error:

<Image src={imgQueryError} alt="Error React Query" />

When debugged, I found that the React Query version I installed is v3. But, in the Github repo mentioned by instructor, the version is 2. So, I downgraded React Query version and it worked.

I made the code working for React Query v3. The solution is to do what is mentioned in the error message. We need to use `QueryClientProvider`.

For that, first import required modules:

```javascript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider, useQuery } from "react-query";
```

Create a queryClient object:

```javascript
const queryClient = new QueryClient();
```

Now we need to create a React component that uses `useQuery`.

```javascript
function GitUsers() {
  const queryUsers = useQuery("gitUsers", () =>
    fetch("https://api.github.com/search/users?q=joby").then((res) =>
      res.json()
    )
  );

  console.log(queryUsers);

  return null;
}
```

Next, we wrap `GitUsers` component inside `QueryClientProvider` inside another React component.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <GitUsers />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

This solved my issue. Hope, it works for you also.
