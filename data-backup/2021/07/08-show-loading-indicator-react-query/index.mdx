We use `useQuery` hook in `react-query` to fetch data from an API. The query object returned by `useQuery` hook has helper properties to find out the status of API request.

Here is an example of fetching user data from Github.

```javascript
const queryUsers = useQuery("gitUsers", () =>
  fetch("https://api.github.com/search/users?q=joby").then((res) => res.json())
);
```

`queryUsers` object now contains a property `status` which returns `"loading"`, `"error"`, or `"success"` based on the state of request.

`queryUsers` also has helper properties to check the state like:

```javascript
console.log(queryUsers.isLoading);
console.log(queryUsers.isError);
console.log(queryUsers.isSuccess);
```

Based on the value of these flags, we can show loading indicator in our React component.
