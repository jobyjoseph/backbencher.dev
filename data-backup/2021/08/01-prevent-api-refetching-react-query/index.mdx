Query in React Query is used to resolve a promise. When a page gets focus, automatically the query will refetch data to keep response up to date. That is how Queries work by default.

Sometimes, due to some reasons like API rate limit, we need to stop this automatic refetching. For that we can use `refetchOnWindowFocus` flag.

Query constructor function accepts a third argument for setting options. If we pass the value of `refetchOnWindowFocus` as `false`, React Query will not refetch automatically.

Here is an example:

```javascript
const queryUsers = useQuery(
  "gitUsers",
  () => {
    return fetch("https://api.github.com/search/users?q=joby").then((res) =>
      res.json()
    );
  },
  {
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  }
);
```
