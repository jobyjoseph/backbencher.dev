In a Query in React Query, if we supply `initialData`, that will be shown by default. Only when user revisits the page, the Query does a network call to refresh the data. This sometimes creates a bad user experience because user is seeing a stale initial data.

We can mark the initialData as stale by setting `initialStale` to `true`.

```javascript
const userQuery = useQuery(
  "user",
  () =>
    fetch(
      "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?email=Sincere@april.biz"
    ).then((res) => res.json()),
  {
    initialData: intialdata,
    initialStale: true, // highlight-line
  }
);
```

Now a user will see the page with initial data immediately. But in the background, the query will go and fetch the latest content and updates the frontend once data is ready.
