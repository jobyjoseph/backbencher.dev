When React Query fetches data, it is cached for around 5 minutes. Caching results helps React Query to show the results instantaneously. If the content is stale, React Query then fetches the response in the background and then updates the front end.

To update the cache time, set the time in query configuration.

```javascript
const queryUsers = useQuery(
  "myquery",
  () => {
    // Fetch data
  },
  {
    cacheTime: 5000,
  }
);
```

As per the above settings, if a query data is not responsive for 5 seconds, it is cleared from the cache. So, after 5 seconds, when the user tries to see the data, there will be a waiting time for completing the API request.
