Next.js helps us to create web applications using React. It is an isomorphic application that supports both server side and client side rendering of React.

In order to start a new project in Next.js, Go to a folder in terminal. This is where we are going to create the Next.js project.

Then type one of the following commands.

```
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

If you are using `yarn`, yarn needs to be installed globally in your machine.

After hitting enter after above command, Next.js will ask for project name. There we can provide a project name which is going to be the folder in which the app is going to reside.

> In `yarn` command, there is no dash(-) in `create next-app` command when compared to `npx` command.

In my case, I used `yarn`. When I run `yarn create next-app`, the interactive process asks me the project name like below:

```
yarn create v1.22.5
