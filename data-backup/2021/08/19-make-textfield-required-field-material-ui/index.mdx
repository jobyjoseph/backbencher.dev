We can use `TextField` component in Material UI to show input textbox.

```javascript
import TextField from "@material-ui/core/TextField";
```

When using the `TextField` component, we can pass the `required` attribute to mark the component as required.

```javascript
<TextField required id="shop-name" label="Shop Name" variant="outlined" />
```

Having `required` attribute prevents the form to be submitted if the field is empty.
