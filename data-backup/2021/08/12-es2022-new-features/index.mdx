New features are added to ECMAScript language by TC39 team. Here is the probable list of features that are expected in ES2022 or ES13.

## Class Static Initialization Blocks

Class `static` blocks perform additional static initialization during class definition evaluation. Currently, this feature is in **Stage 3**.

Right now, we can declare static variables and methods inside a class. Example:

```javascript
class A {
  static fruit = "Apple";
  static dish = "";
  static show() {
    return "I ate Apple";
  }
}
```

Later, if we need to do an evaluation on this static properties, we need to do it **outside** the class definition.

```javascript
try {
  const obj = whatToCook(A.fruit);
  A.dish = obj.dish;
} catch {
  A.dish = "Pie";
}
```

Using `static` blocks, we can now move this code inside class `A`.

```javascript
class A {
  static fruit = "Apple";
  static dish = "";
  static show() {
    return "I ate Apple";
  }
  static {
    try {
      const obj = whatToCook(A.fruit);
      A.dish = obj.dish;
    } catch {
      A.dish = "Pie";
    }
  }
}
```
