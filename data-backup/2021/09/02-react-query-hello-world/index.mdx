description: One can start trying out React Query with a simple Query. Query in React Query is used to fetch data from a promise and updates the state. Queries are customizable using their configuration object.

In this section, we are going to write our first React Query code. Before starting with code, we need to install `react-query` in our project using:

```
yarn add react-query
```

Next, we can go to our code editor. We need to have an environment where we can write React components and execute them. I have setup a project using `create-react-app`.

## useQuery Hook

As part of this getting started code, we will be using `useQuery` hook from React Query. `useQuery` hook is used to create query objects.

To do that, first, create a React component in `App.js` file.

```javascript
function Gitusers() {}
```

In this example, the query object will be retrieving Github users using Github API. That is why I have given the name as `Gitusers`.

Inside the component, we make use of `useQuery` hook to get the user details. For that, first we need to import `useQuery` from `react-query`.

```javascript
// highlight-start
import { useQuery } from "react-query";
// highlight-end

function Gitusers() {
  // highlight-start
  const gitUsers = useQuery("gitusers", async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get(
      "https://api.github.com/search/users?q=react"
    );
    return data;
  });
  // highlight-end
}
```

The `gitUsers` const variable is now a query object. We can retrieve the server state of Github users from `gitUsers` object. Later, we will see how we make different decisions based on the state values.

We use `axios` to make the API request. Please make sure to install and include `axios` package.

Before moving further, let me show you the different building blocks we used.

First, the `useQuery` hooks accepts a string `"gitusers"` as first argument. This unique key is used by React Query to identify the promise it is connected.

The promise I mentioned is the one returned by `axios.get()`. Query object automatically re-render `Gitusers` component based on the AJAX request states.

## Using Query Object

Now we have the query object `gitUsers` which listens to the Github API request. Let us design a component that is returned by `Gitusers` component.

```javascript
function Gitusers() {
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      {gitUsers.isLoading ? (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Total result count: {gitUsers.data?.total_count}</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

Basically what is happening here is, the query object `gitUsers` has some helper attributes like `isLoading`. We can make use of these flags to inform the users what is happening right now.

## Using Component

Now our `Gitusers` component is ready to be used. We use it in `App` component.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Gitusers />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `Gitusers` component is wrapped inside `QueryClientProvider`. The provider needs a `client` attribute which contains a QueryClient object. You can see how the QueryClient object is created and the full code below:

```javascript
import { useQuery, QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import axios from "axios";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function Gitusers() {
  const gitUsers = useQuery("gitusers", async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get(
      "https://api.github.com/search/users?q=react"
    );
    return data;
  });
  return (
    <>
      {gitUsers.isLoading ? (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Total result count: {gitUsers.data?.total_count}</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Gitusers />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
