import Divider from "../../../../src/components/divider";

**Question:**

What is `Link` component in Next.js? How is it used?

**Answer:**

`Link` component is used to do **client-side routing**. In order to use `Link` component, first we need to import it from `next/link`.

```javascript
import Link from "next/link";

//...

<Link href="/">
  <a>Home</a>
</Link>;
```

`href` attribute accepts the path of the target page. If we need to do server side routing or link to external url, use html anchor(`<a/>`) tag.

<Divider />

**Question:**

In my `pages` folder, there is a file at `products/[slug].jsx`. It handles the product details page of my ecommerce website. How can we link to this dynamic page from _category_ page?

**Answer:**

In the _Category_ page, lets assume we get the products list under the category from an API response. We can then loop through the response and dynamically create `Link` component.

```javascript
foreach(product in products) {
  <Link href={"/product/" + product.slug}>
    <a>{product.name}</a>
  </Link>
}
```

<Divider />

**Question:**

I am trying to link a custom React component(`<MyButton>`) to another page.

```javascript
const MyButton = () => <button>My Button</button>;

function index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/about">
        <MyButton />
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

But on clicking the button, it is not navigating to `/about` page. Why?

**Answer:**

If we are using `Link` component around custom React component, the navigation will not work. We can take 2 approach to make this working.

First approach is to wrap `<MyButton/>` inside anchor tag:

```javascript
<Link href="/about">
  <a>
    <MyButton />
  </a>
</Link>
```

Second approach is to wrap `button` tag inside anchor tag. In that case, we need to use `passHref` to pass the target link to React component. Here is the full updated code.

```javascript
const MyButton = ({ href }) => (
  <a href={href}>
    <button>My Button</button>
  </a>
);

function index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/about" passHref>
        <MyButton />
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```
