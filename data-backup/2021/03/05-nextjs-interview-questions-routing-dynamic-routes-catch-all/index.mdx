**Question:**

How can we setup routes in Next.js? If I need two pages with urls `/` and `about` in Next.js, what should we do?

**Answer:**

In Next.js, we just have to follow its convention. Create a `pages` folder in the root and create two files inside it. The file names should be `index.js` and `about.js`. It can be `.jsx` files also. The url path is decided by the file name. `index.js` maps to `/` path.

**Question:**

I am working on a Next.js project. The _pages_ folder structure looks like this:

<Image
  src={imagePagesFolder}
  style={{ maxWidth: "200px", display: "block", margin: "auto" }}
  alt="Next.js Pages folder"
/>

What will be the urls generated based on this folder structure?

**Answer:**

Three urls will be created.

```
/
/category/men
/category/women
```

**Question:**

If I have 2 files that resolve to same url, what will happen in Next.js? For example, what will happen when we run a Next.js project with following _pages_ folder structure?

<Image
  src={imageSameURLPagesFolder}
  style={{ maxWidth: "160px", display: "block", margin: "auto" }}
  alt="Next.js Same url Pages folder"
/>

**Answer:**

Here when we try to take `/category` url, it will render the page from _pages/category.jsx_. But Next.js warns the developer in the console, saying:

```
Duplicate page detected. pages/category.jsx and pages/category/index.jsx both resolve to /category.
```

**Question:**

How to handle dynamic routes in Next.js? For example: In my ecommerce site, the category page has dynamic routes. `/category/men` lists all products under _men_. `/category/shoes` lists all products under _shoes_. So the category name which comes after `/category/` is dynamic. How should we design the _pages_ folder structure to handle this request?

**Answer:**

First create a folder `category` under `pages` folder. Then create a file named `[category].jsx` inside `category` folder. Inside the square brackets we can use any valid identifier. This identifier is later used to extract the value of dynamic route.

Next we define a component in `[category].jsx`.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

function Category() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { category } = router.query;
  return <div>{category}</div>;
}

export default Category;
```

Here we defined a functional component. That is why we used `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. We create a `router` object and later extract the `category` value from `router.query`.

**Question:**

If I name a file under `pages` folder as `[...params].jsx`, what does that mean?

**Answer:**

It means, you just created a catch-all route. If `[...params].jsx` is present under `pages/products` folder, then all unhandled urls starting with `/products` end up in `[...params].jsx`.

In the jsx file, we can extract the url path from `params` property.
