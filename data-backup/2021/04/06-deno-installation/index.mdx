[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a JavaScript Runtime that is built on V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It is built by Ryan Dahl, the author of Node.js.

At the time of writing, Deno just launched v1.0. Let us try to install Deno in our laptop.

My machine is a Macbook Pro. The official site lists many options to install Deno in different operating systems.

First, open the terminal. Execute the following command.

```
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

When we install above command, Deno asks us to add some variables to the environment.

```
...
Manually add the directory to your $HOME/.bash_profile (or similar)
  export DENO_INSTALL="/Users/<username>/.deno"
  export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
Run '/Users/joby/.deno/bin/deno --help' to get started
```

As per the instructions, open `.bash_profile` file in any editor. Add below 2 lines as the last lines of the file.

```
export DENO_INSTALL="/Users/<username>/.deno"
export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

Replace `<username>` with your machine username.

Now Deno is successfully installed in your machine. We can verify the installation by typing following command in terminal.

```
deno --version
```

We can see the following output if everything went well.

```
deno 1.0.2
v8 8.4.300
typescript 3.9.2
```
