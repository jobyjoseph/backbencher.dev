JavaScript can deal with different kinds of values.

## Number value

Here is an example of number values.

```javascript
23;
67.21;
```

Some programming language consider above two numbers as different types, like _int_ and _float_. But, JavaScript consider both as a _number_ value. There is no distinction between a number with decimal and without decimal in JavaScript.

## String value

When a value is wrapped with double quotes(`""`) or single quotes(`''`) or back tick(` `` `), that is a _string_ value in JavaScript.

```javascript
"I am a string";
"I am a string"`I am a string`;
```

## Boolean value

Two values in JavaScript are boolean values. They are `true` and `false`.

## null and undefined

The values `null` and `undefined` are referred to as empty values in JavaScript.

`undefined` value denotes a declared variable but not assigned. So in JavaScript, we declare a variable and try to get its value, `undefined` is returned.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined.
```

`null` value is used to mark an intentional absense of an object. Say, we have a function that returns an object. If that function does not have an object to return, it should return `null`.

Example. `match()` is a string method that returns an array of all matches in a string based on a regular expression.

```javascript
var str = "Backbencher is the new frontbencher";
var result = str.match(/apple/g);
console.log(result); // null
```

In the above code, we are searching for string `"apple"` in `str`. If there is a match, the method returns an Array. Since there is no match, it returned `null`.

> In JavaScript, a function that returns an object should never return `undefined` to tell intentional absense of an object. It is because, a function by default returns `undefined` during invocation. So we cannot distinguish the origin of `undefined` and what purpose it serves.

## Array values

Array is a collection of values. The values can be of any type. We represent an array using `[]` syntax.

Here are some examples.

```javascript
[1, 2, 3][("Apple", "Banana", "Orange")][(2, "John", 4.89)];
```

Array is an example of data structure that stores each element in contiguous memory locations.

## Object values

Objects are another kind of data structure in JavaScript that store data in key value pairs.

Example:

```javascript
{
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23
}
```

Values and its different types in JavaScript help us to perform various kinds of operations on them.
