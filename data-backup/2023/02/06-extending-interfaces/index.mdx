We can implement inheritance in interfaces.

Say we have an interface for `Person`:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}
```

Also, we have another interface for `Teacher`:

```typescript
interface Teacher {
  subject: string;
}
```

Now if we have a class `Master` that needs to implement both `Person` and `Teacher`, we can do like this:

```typescript
class Master implements Person, Teacher {
  name;
  subject;
}
```

Above way is one technique.

There is another way. We know that a `Teacher` interface always needs to have a `name` also. Therefore, we can extend `Teacher` from `Person`.

```typescript
interface Teacher extends Person {
  subject: string;
}
```

Once `Teacher` extends `Person`, we need to implement only `Teacher`.

```typescript
class Master implements Teacher {
  name;
  subject;
}
```
