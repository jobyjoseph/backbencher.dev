In order to use or try Decorators in TypeScript, we need to enable it. Enabling Decorators can be done from `tsconfig.json` file.

If the `tsconfig.json` file has been created using `tsc init` command, the file would have a default configuration. The file also has many configurations that are commented.

One such commented option is `experimentalDecorators`. Uncomment the line that contains `experimentalDecorators` json property and ensure that its value is `true`.

Doing the above step will enable Decorators in TypeScript.
