We can set constraints to Generic types. Constraints allow us to accept only certain types that can be passed as generic types.

Here is a generic function:

```typescript
function mergeObject<T, U>(obj1: T, obj2: U) {
  return Object.assign(obj1, obj2);
}
```

We want both arguments to be objects. Then only the function works properly. What if we are invoking the function as below:

```typescript
mergeObject({ name: "Joby" }, 30);
```

In the above function, second argument is a number. That was not intended.

TypeScript provides a way to constraint the type of `T` or `U`. Here is how we restrict `T` and `U` to be an object.

```typescript
function mergeObject<T extends object, U extends object>(obj1: T, obj2: U) {
  return Object.assign(obj1, obj2);
}
```

Using the `extends` keyword, we can make sure that the passed type is constrained to certain type.
