Interfaces in TypeScript can also be used to define the type of a function.

Without interface, we can define the type of a function as below:

```typescript
type sumFn = (a: number, b: number) => number;
```

Then later we can use the type as follows:

```typescript
const sum: sumFn = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

Now let us see how to implement `sumFn` type using `interface`.

```typescript
interface sumFn {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
```

Note that there is no `=>` syntax in the above snippet.
