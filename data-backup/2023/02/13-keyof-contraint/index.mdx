`keyof` constraint in TypeScript generics make sure that the value passed is a key of another object.

Here is a simple function that returns the value of an object property passed:

```typescript
function boom(obj: object, key: string) {
  return obj[key];
}
```

After that we are calling the function like below:

```typescript
boom({}, "age");
```

Above code does not throw an error. But, it is not valid as we know that key `age` is not there in an empty object.

What if we need to make sure that the passed key is an existing key in the object? We can use `keyof` constraint in Generics.

```typescript
function boom<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: U) {
  return obj[key];
}
```

It says that, the second argument should be a key of first argument.
