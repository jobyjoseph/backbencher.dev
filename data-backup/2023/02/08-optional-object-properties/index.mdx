We can mark a particular property in an object as optional in TypeScript.

Consider following JavaScript object:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Joby",
  isMarried: true,
  spouseName: "Ninu",
};
```

The property `spouseName` should be optional. Only if `isMarried` is `true`, `spouseName` has relevance.

We can mark a property as optional by adding a **question mark** after the property name. Here is how the interface of person looks like:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  isMarried: boolean;
  spouseName?: string; // highlight-line
}
```

The optional question mark can also be used for class properties and function parameters.
