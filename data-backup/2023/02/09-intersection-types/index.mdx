Intersection types allow us to combine other types.

Say, we have an interface for `Person`:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  gender: string;
}
```

There is also an another interface for `Farmer`:

```typescript
interface Farmer {
  crop: string;
}
```

Now, for some reasons we need a new interface that contains the properties of both `Person` and `Farmer`. One option is to list out all properties again as shown below:

```typescript
interface PersonFarmer {
  name: string;
  gender: string;
  crop: string;
}
```

Or, we can use intersection operator like below:

```typescript
type PersonFarmer = Person & Farmer;
```

Note that we need to use `type` when we use intersection operator. Instead of `type`, if we need to use `interface` for `PersonFarmer`, then we can consider extending `Person` and `Farmer`.
