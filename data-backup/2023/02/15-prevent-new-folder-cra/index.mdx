We can use `create-react-app` command to setup a React project with all the necessary tools. We can even setup a React project with TypeScript support.

As per the official documentation, the command to spin-up a new React project in `my-app` folder is:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Above command creates a new folder `my-app` and all the project files inside it. But, in some cases we do not want the command to create new folder. We already have a project folder, where we need the project files to be generated.

In that case, navigate to the folder and use below command:

```
npx create-react-app .
```

The dot(`.`) makes all the difference. Now, a new folder is not created.
