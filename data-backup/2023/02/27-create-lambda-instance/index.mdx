To create an instance of the AWS Lambda service client using the JavaScript AWS SDK, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const lambda = new AWS.Lambda({
  region: "your-aws-region",
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key-id",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-access-key",
});
```

Here's a brief explanation of what's happening in this code:

- First, we require the `aws-sdk` module, which provides us with access to the AWS SDK for JavaScript.
- Next, we create a new instance of the AWS Lambda service client using the `AWS.Lambda` constructor function. We pass in an object with the following properties:

  - `region`: The AWS region in which the Lambda function will be created and executed.
  - `accessKeyId`: The access key ID for an AWS IAM user with permissions to access the Lambda service. This property is optional if you're using a default credentials provider, such as the AWS SDK's default credential chain.
  - `secretAccessKey`: The secret access key for the IAM user. This property is also optional if you're using a default credentials provider.

Once you've created an instance of the AWS Lambda service client, you can use it to interact with the Lambda service API and manage Lambda functions in your AWS account.
