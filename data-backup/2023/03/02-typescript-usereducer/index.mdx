The TypeScript type of the `action` parameter in the `useReducer` hook depends on the type of the `reducer` function that you are using.

In general, the `action` parameter can have any type that is compatible with the action types that the `reducer` function expects. For example, if your `reducer` function expects actions of type `{ type: string, payload: any }`, then the `action` parameter in `useReducer` should have that same type or a subtype of it.

Here's an example of how you could define a `Reducer` type that takes a specific action type:

```typescript
type MyActionType = { type: string; payload: any };

type MyStateType = {
  /* ... */
};

type MyReducerType = (state: MyStateType, action: MyActionType) => MyStateType;
```

In this example, `MyActionType` represents the shape of the actions that your reducer expects, `MyStateType` represents the shape of your state, and `MyReducerType` is the type of the reducer function that you will pass to `useReducer`.
