Any type is the most flexible type you can assign in TypeScript. This type does not tell TypeScript anything about any type. A variable that is declared using _Any_ type can store any value.

```typescript
let a: any;
```

Now `a` can contain any values. Because of that TypeScript will not throw any error in the below 3 lines of code.

```typescript
let a: any;
a = 10;
a = "Apple";
```

`any` takes away all advantages TypeScript gives you. Therefore, it is not advised to use `any` data type.
