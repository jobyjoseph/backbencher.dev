In TypeScript, we can explicitly define the type of a variable as shown below:

```typescript
let age: number = 5;
```

But in the above case, even without the explicity `number` type, TypeScript can infer the type by the value assigned, which is `5`.

Observe the code below.

```typescript
let age = 5;
age = "Five";
```

The second line throws an error because TypeScript already infered the type of `age` as `number`.
