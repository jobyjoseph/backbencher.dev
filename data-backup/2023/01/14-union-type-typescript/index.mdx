As the name suggests, **union** type helps variables to have more than one type. Here is a variable that can have either a `number` type or a `string` type or a `boolean` type.

```typescript
let a: number | string | boolean;
```

`|` is the union operator. All the assignments below are valid due to union operator.

```typescript
a = 10;
a = "Apple";
a = true;
```

But, if we try to assign an object literal to `a`, it throws error as shown below:
