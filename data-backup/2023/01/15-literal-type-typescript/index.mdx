Instead of saying, a variable can contain a string or a number, literal type forces a particular value to a variable.

## Literal type with const

We have a const variable in our code:

```typescript
const num = 80;
```

Since a `const` variable cannot be reassigned, TypeScript marks the type of `num` as `80`(Not `number`).

```typescript
const num: 80;
```

That was an example of literal type.

## Combining literal types using or operator

If a variable can have only two values `apple` or `banana`, we can set the type as follows:

```typescript
let a: "apple" | "banana";
```
