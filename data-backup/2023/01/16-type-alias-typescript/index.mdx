If we have a union type like below:

```typescript
let a: number | string;
let b: number | string;
```

It is difficult to repeat `number | string` every time. **Type aliases** makes this easy.

```typescript
type numstr = number | string;
```

After declaring our custom type, we can use it as below:

```typescript
let a: numstr;
let b: numstr;
```
