If our project is a TypeScript project, when we run `tsc` command, all the TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript files. But what if, we want to exclude certain files from compilation?

Say we have three files in our project:

```
app.ts
analytics.ts
tracking.ts
```

When we run `tsc` command, only `app.ts` needs to compile. For that, we need to add `exclude` property in `tsconfig.json` file.

Open `tsconfig.json` file. Your file might look like this now:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Add `exclude` property in the root level as shown below:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "exclude": ["analytics.ts", "tracking.ts"]
}
```

We can use wild card(`*`) in the file name pattern.
