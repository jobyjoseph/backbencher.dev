Vanilla JavaScript does not contain tuple data type. TypeScript brings Tuple Type.

## What is Tuple?

It is an array with fixed length and fixed value. Example:

```typescript
const role = [4, "teacher"];
```

Above array elements have a meaning. `4` is role id and `"teacher"` is role description. Any other array values like, `[4, "teacher", true]` is invalid.

We cannot create a tuple in vanilla JavaScript.

## Defining a Tuple in TypeScript

Here is how we can set a tuple type using TypeScript.

```typescript
let role: [number, string];
```

Above type says, `role` can have an array whose length should be 2. Also, the first element should be a number and second one a string.
