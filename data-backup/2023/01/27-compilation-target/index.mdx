When we do `tsc --init` to initialize a TypeScript project, it generates a `tsconfig.json` file. We can see a JSON object with `compilerOptions` property. We can generate ES6 output by setting `target` to `ES6` or `ES2015`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //...
    "target": "ES6"
  }
}
```

If our TypeScript code is:

```typescript
let a = 10;

const obj = {
  name: 10,
};

const response = {
  ...obj,
  age: 23,
};
```

When we target to `ES6`, the output will be:

```javascript
"use strict";
let a = 10;
const obj = {
  name: 10,
};
const response = Object.assign(Object.assign({}, obj), { age: 23 });
```

As you can see, the `let` is retained because `let` is available in ES6. Whereas object spread operator was release in ES2018. Therefore object spread operator is converted to ES5 way.

If the target is set to ES2018, the output will be:

```javascript
"use strict";
let a = 10;
const obj = {
  name: 10,
};
const response = {
  ...obj,
  age: 23,
};
```
