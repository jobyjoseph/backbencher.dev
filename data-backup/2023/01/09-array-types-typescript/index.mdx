Just like other data types, TypeScript can define the type of an array using different techniques.

## Inferred Array Type

Here is a normal array variable which is initialized with an array.

```typescript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
```

Here is the type automatically inferred by TypeScript from the assigned array.

```typescript
const fruits: string[];
```

## Mixed Data Types

Let us have an array that has elements of different types.

```typescript
const fruits = ["Apple", 23];
```

Now the inferred type for `fruits` is:

```typescript
const fruits: (string | number)[];
```

It says that the array can contain either a string value or a number value.

## Set Types Explicitly

Say, we need to declare a variable `marks` that will contain an array of marks which are numbers. We can declare the variable with its type like below:

```typescript
let marks: number[];
```

Then, later we can assign a number array to `marks`.

```typescript
marks = [23, 45];
```

What if we assign a string array to `marks`? TypeScript can throw an error.
