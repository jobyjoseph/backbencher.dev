If the `id` of an input element is `myAge`, we can get the value of the text box using:

```javascript
const age = document.getElementById("myAge");
console.log(age.value);
```

But, TypeScript is not sure if `age` will always contain a property called `value`. Due to that reason TypeScript will throw an error in second line.

We can do type casting and tell TypeScript that `age` is a HTML input using `HTMLInputElement`.

```typescript
const age = document.getElementById("myAge") as HTMLInputElement;
console.log(age.value);
```
