TypeScript has an enum type. The sequence of numbering starts from zero by default. We can change the number sequencing in TypeScript.

## Default Sequence

Here is an `enum` type:

```typescript
enum Role {
  ADMIN,
  READ_ONLY,
  AUTHOR,
}
```

Here `ADMIN` gets `0`, `READ_ONLY` gets `1` and `AUTHOR` gets `2`.

What if we want `ADMIN` to have `1`, `READ_ONLY` to have `2` and `AUTHOR` to have `5`?

We can do like below:

```typescript
enum Role {
  ADMIN = 1,
  READ_ONLY,
  AUTHOR = 5,
}
```

In the above example `READ_ONLY` gets number `2` by auto increment from previous one.
