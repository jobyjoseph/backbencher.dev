In my current project, we are using serverless package for one of the modules to deploy around 20 lambda functions. What happened was for each build, a new version of lambda is created and stored. This resulted in reaching the maximum code storage limit of 75GB pretty soon.

Gitlab pipeline started failing. For few weeks, we wrote a script to delete the lambda versions and ran it whenever required. But that was not a permanent solution. So, we tried **serverless-prune-plugin**.

## Setup

Install the `serverless-prune-plugin`.

```shell
yarn add serverless-prune-plugin --dev
```

## Update Serverless Config

Add serverless-prune-plugin to the list of plugins in either `serverless.ts` or `serverless.yml`. Mine was a `.ts`.

```javascript
plugins: [
    'serverless-prune-plugin',
  ],
```

Since, I had to run this pruning automatically, I added the rules to `custom` attribute in `serverless.ts`.

```javascript
custom: {
    prune: {
      automatic: true,
      number: 3,
    },
  },
```

## Output

Now when the pipeline runs, it showed that the pruning was successful.

```
âœ” Pruning of functions complete
```

In my case _75GB_ space got reduced to _45GB_.
